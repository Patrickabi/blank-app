The cap leaks, sometimes when I pull the bite cover off water pulls out due to suction, it doesn't stay in the stationary positions it originally did.

2.0,I miss the old Contigo bottles,"So I've always been a fan of Contigo until I've gotten this one. I like the flip top and the material the mouthpiece has(I have a tendency to chew on them and its always so durable and soft). This one is much bigger, so it has the wide base, which is ok, but its a bit awkward to hold while filling up since you have to grab it by the top part. It has a fold handle for grabbing, but there isn't a build in grip like the old Contigos had, so you can't clip it directly on your bag unless you buy a carabiner or clip separately.<br /><br />Now the biggest issue I have with this, the reason I rated it 2 stars, is that the straw inside just inserts into the underside of the lid. This causes issues with the straw lining up in the bottom side, I frequently have to drink from the bottle backwards to get that last little bit of water in there. It also sometimes falls out when I take off the lid since its just held in with a light grip. The old Contigos screwed into the lid with a harder plastic straw, but it was at an angle that forced it forward so you just drink normally to get the last bits of water at the bottom.<br /><br />Last little bit that forced me to give a low rating, it sometimes acts funny and spits or leaks at times. I layed this sideways on the couch, completely closed once, and the water leaked into the couch(no biggie, its just water, but it shouldn't have leaked like that, I even had the straw tip closed up and sealed). But I've also seen this thing spit up water as soon as I open up the mouthpiece, it just comes out like a weak fountain, like there was pressure build up on the inside. With the old Contigos, I've only had this geyser happen to me when I left it in the hot car, which the heat would have built up plenty pressure.

So far with this one, he’s lost the bite valve three times which it never fell off the old one so we’ve had to buy replacements but now also, there is another rubber piece that the straw connects to and then that goes up to the bite valve...this was plastic on the old Eddy, sometimes the straw would fall out of the cap but at least you could just put it back in and continue to drink from it.  Now that this other price broke, you can’t even suck water through it.  and worse yet, I don’t see that part for sale so it renders a $20 water bottle completely useless.

I have owned many Nalgene products but I would not rate this as “survival gear” instead for weekend hikers or office workers.  The benefit to this softer material  is, it probably will not crack or shatter as easily if dropped in extreme cold conditions, as it provides more flex. Adding  .040” (1mm) to thickness would make all the difference.  I’d like to see the drop test data on various surfaces (jagged rocks) from different bottle orientations.

2.0,Great until I found the mold,"I bought this for the glass water bottle I had and spent a solid 10-15 minutes trying to get it on, but it wouldn't fit. I set up a return thinking that it clearly didn't fit, but it was a returnless refund so rather than just throwing it out, I decided to try it again. And of course that's when it decided to fit. Once I figured out how to get it on (and it definitely took some practice), I loved it. The opening you drink out of was a perfect size with perfect flow, and it never leaked. Then last night after washing it (after only 2 1/2 months of using it) I found the mold. As you can see in the pictures, there's a rubber ring in the part that attaches to the bottle, AND in the cap for the mouth piece. It's also important to note that these rubber rings are not removable. Thankfully I was holding the top in just the right position in just the right light, that I saw some of the mold on the top of the larger rubber ring (which I wouldn't have seen otherwise). It's a really small area in there, so I used a toothpick and paper towel to try to scrape the mold off. Then I found it on the smaller rubber ring (which touches the mouth piece, by the way) and tried to remove that with a toothpick and paper towel too. At one point, I don't remember which ring I was working on, but the toothpick slipped and poked a hole in between the rubber ring and the plastic, and all of a sudden moldy water came pouring out from UNDERNEATH the rubber ring. I don't know how water managed to get in there, but it clearly did and it didn't come back out, so it just got moldy and built up in there until I made an accidental hole.<br />I also don't know how long the mold had been there, but it's incredibly difficult to see it on top of the rubber ring (unless you're in the right light or you use a flashlight) let alone impossible to know if it's underneath the ring, so I'm guessing it was there for a while. And I never would have figured out it was UNDER the ring if the toothpick hadn't accidentally poked a hole between the ring and the plastic.<br />Needless to say, once I found that amount of mold and found it under the rings, I threw the top away since there's no way to clean under the rubber rings because they aren't removable. I'm also fairly frustrated because I'm allergic to mold, and was likely coming into contact with it (if nothing else at least from the cap that touches and covers the mouth piece) for who knows how long.<br />I gave it 2 stars because it would be the perfect top if it didn't get moldy where you can't clean it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7158WtbbmwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7158WtbbmwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7158WtbbmwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IgDV1AIFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IgDV1AIFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IgDV1AIFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B077MHF5G4,B07CJQQXS4,AEEG2MPSYWXT2IZV6SPKP6ZLP7IA,1633642664636,5,True,CamelBak,Eastman Tritan™ Copolyester,Replacement part,Black,"Carrying Loop, Magnetic Cap, Leak-proof when closed",900.0,0

Yes, it's worth taking off 3 stars.<br /><br />The water bottle is billed as leak proof - probably one of the most important features, but if you miss a thread when closing the cap (which is sometimes actually very difficult to notice) then the bottle will most certainly leak over ALL your things.

1.0,TL;DR It's supposed to be tough but it's not.,"I love Nalgene and their bottles and this bottle was no different. Well at least for two days until it fell out of my hands onto soft grass and broke right away. My wide mouth bottle has been dropped from eight feet, dropped on concrete, even dropped on my kitchen floor which is so hard that it broke my grandma's arm and yet my original Nalgene has survived all of these but one drop in the soft grass from about four feet has completely ruined it. If I decide to buy another narrow mouth bottle I will have to be extremely careful not to drop it even on a bed of feathers without the fear of the bottle breaking.<br />Nalgene makes great bottles and I want to have this bottle but I will not pay for another one with the potential of it breaking in a few days of having it. Maybe I'll ask for it as a gift when it isn't my money on the line. maybe I'll try to return it as I feel this might be a faulted bottle and others won't be so weak. We'll see and hope the next one is stronger.<br />TL;DR It's supposed to be tough but it's not.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B4-gMO4NL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B4-gMO4NL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B4-gMO4NL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lo+tdgC0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lo+tdgC0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lo+tdgC0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B001NCDE4S,B001NCDE4S,AFLS2MAFQVOB4P45YOBFLSGHQ7AA,1503512548515,1,True,Nalgene,Tritan copolyester,,Slate Blue,"Dishwasher Safe,Leak Proof,Narrow Mouth",1000.0,0

2.0,Update:  rusts,"1-year update:  it's rusting in the bottom inside.

This Eddy+ iteration fixes several of the gripes I had with the original:<br /><br />1.  The straw attachment is much better<br />2.  The loop is much nicer on the fingers to hold<br />3.  The size fits better in cup holders<br />4.  The bite valve isn't super hard to suck when it's brand new.<br /><br />However, it does have several of its own failings:<br /><br />1.  The bite valve does not lock in the erect position.  This makes it much harder to drink by touch - if you bump it with your lip, it will flop down.<br />2.  The powder coating is not terribly durable.  Mine is already scuffed, after one day of usage.<br /><br />Additionally, I don't appreciate the volume decrease and price increase to account for the vacuum insulation.

2.0,This bottle is fine... If you never knew the previous model existed...,"I am not going to say that this water bottle is difficult to open, but it is not intuitive what so ever.<br /><br />This water bottle would probably work fine for someone who naturally unscrews caps with their right hand, but the vast majority of people unscrew bottles with their left hand.<br /><br />The way the bottle is designed (with the bottle cap opening to the right side) makes it very annoying and difficult to open with left hand. For those that use their left hand, you have to push the cap up off of the spout (the last model would just pop off so no need for this step) across the opposite side.<br /><br />Then after you've moved the cap out of the way, you can finally drink your water.<br /><br />The original model had a much more fluid motion, pun intended, way of drinking water.<br /><br />Why they ruined a perfectly good model for an inferior product is beyond me. probably $$<br /><br />Still on the fence on the entire lid being removable, as the last model's lid was held on by the plastic. Not a huge fan of this, as you will now have to hold the cap (increasing the potential of it getting lost, so hey probably more $$ for them right) while you refill the bottle. It does however, make it easier to clean.<br /><br />The old product was SOOO much better. You don't realize how annoying these changes are, unless you've tried the previous model.

2.0,Updated review!,"UPDATE: I originally gave this item 5 stars when I made my initial purchase about 3yrs ago. This week I bought a 2nd 21oz bottle to replace my very worn original. I am giving 2 stars now for 2 reasons:<br />1) The bottle that arrived looks like it was bought and returned! The label was scotch taped together after what looks like being ripped off the bottle (see photo) I can only assume after someone bought it. Also there are water stains on the inside bottom of the bottle. Amazon should NOT be sending out returned items that people drink out of.<br />2) The bottle that arrived has a different design than my original Healthy Human. The bottom of the 1st bottle had a concave surface. The new one has a convex surface. The popped out bottom makes it wobble when you put it down which is annoying. I took a picture of the bottom of my old one next to the new one for comparison. I wish they kept the same design.<br /><br />Original review...<br />I had ice water in it and left it in my car while I attended a wedding shower on a very hot June day. 5hrs later it was still full of ice! Definitely keeps your drink cold. Awesome insulation on this canister. I like the wider mouth on it, easier to clean than some of the other brands with narrow mouths. This is also helpful when adding full size ice cubes.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zpW3mOFsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zpW3mOFsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zpW3mOFsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919XJHsVcOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919XJHsVcOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919XJHsVcOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1BEcxjlisL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1BEcxjlisL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1BEcxjlisL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00YIVH3I4,B0BGM8TW2T,AGLZTVOKIS62U2Q7JZ7JBI3HQWHA,1573269176620,0,True,Healthy Human,steel,,Bahama,,470.0,0

The old design has a small opening that fits in your mouth and the flow is controlled by a push button at your fingertips. It’s designed to use while biking or walking or being active. The newer one has a giant lid that opens up in your face and then you have to try to not spill the water from the large opening revealed by the open cover.

1.0,Breaks EASILY and warranty not honoured,"I bought seven of these bottles for myself and my family based on my initial purchase. That was over the last couple of years and I bought them because I really like the way that the spout works and how easy they are to refill.<br /><br />But out of those 7, four have shattered, every time based on a drop from less than 2 feet onto the ground or floor. Each time they break it’s at the same point in the bottom part of the bottle (see photo) with a crack running horizontally around the bottle, sending the water everywhere and rendering the bottle useless.<br /><br />I really can’t understand or justify this because it is a water bottle after all ...and it should be more durable.  The one that broke today fell out of the water bottle pocket in my backpack as I was bending over to tie up my boots and again it was about a 2 foot drop from where I was sitting to the floor. The thing instantly shattered flooding all my gear and my floor. I would expect that from fine crystal but NOT from a plastic water bottle that we are told we can carry hiking, running or during gym workouts.<br /><br />When I contacted the company about their supposed money back guarantee (proudly announced in a sticker on the bottle) I was told I had to send ALL the bottles to California for review. They wanted me to spend as much on postage as I had paid for the original bottles, so they could look them over in person and then decide whether or not to do something for me. This is outrageous, as there is clearly a design flaw and shipping them would be costly in terms of time, dollars and carbon output. I offered to ship one bottle so they could see the damage (it is the same with each one that broke) and I sent photos and explained the situation. I was just told “send the bottles” again.  I also asked if I could take the bottles to a local store and get replacements under the warranty and was told that I could “try but that it is not guaranteed” and in fact when I went into the store that Camelbak suggested (where I got 2 of the bottles) I was told that there was nothing that could be done as it is a warranty issue and to ""send the bottles to California"". So faulty product, poor service, and foolish/wasteful expectations.  I also asked if I could take the bottles to a local store and get replacements under the warranty and was told that I could try but the store (recommended by Camelbak and where I bought some of the bottles) said ""no, its a warranty issue"". So faulty product, very poor service, and an expectation of wasting time and money. And here is the final part of my dissatisfaction; I raised my concerns about wasteful shipping (costs/carbon/time) because I thought Camelbak would get it. Apparently not, even though it says this on their Website ""Taking meaningful steps to reduce their carbon footprint, including reducing water waste, saving energy..."" referring to their suppliers. It does not seem to apply to themselves or their clients though. Very disappointing...<br /><br />I Used to really like CamelBak and I’ve bought a lot of their products over the years and used to recommend them, but I’ve largely given up on them now and won’t be buying any more of their products.

My wife had the same issues with the Camelbak straw water bottle.  I never had this problem with my Nalgene water bottle.

2.0,"Flawed LID, Great bottle","We have purchased 6 of these in three different colors over the past year for our family.  The bottle is nice, but the lids are too fragile.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - keeps drinks cold all day long<br /> - The paint is holding up reasonably well (it does have spots where it is missing paint from where it was dropped, as expected)<br /> - normal ice cubes fit in the mouth of it<br /> - it fits in average sized cup holders<br /> - the lid locks so it is less likely to leak when put inside of bags<br /> - relatively easy to wash<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - THE LID - The clear part of the lid is brittle and breaks way too easily.<br /><br />We have purchased 10 bottles with the same exact lid in the past year (4 were the larger sized bottle).  One lid leaked from the very start.  No matter which bottle we put it on or how we adjust the seal, it still leaked.  We kept it because we could use the clear plastic piece off of it to put on a broken one and make a good one.  Out of the 10 lids that we started with, 5 of them broke within the first 6 months.  I contacted Thermos several times and they told me for months that the lid was on backorder.  They finally became available, but they did not offer to replace the faulty lids.  They said I could purchase a maximum of 2 (due to demand) for $2.50 each plus shipping.  I explained that 2 was not nearly enough and after a while the person agreed to sell me 4.  Out of 14 total lids, we have 7 good ones left.  We keep putting them back together with super glue and reusing the broken ones.  When they no longer stay together with super glue, we recycle the lid and use a new one.<br /><br />How do they break?  I was holding one from the loop about 2 feet from the ground.  It slipped and fell flat on the bottom (not on the lid at all).  The clear little plastic piece that goes into the release broke.  Now it won't stay closed and super glue doesn't work to hold it.  The same exact thing happened to my son who is much closer to the ground than I am.  Another one, I put the bottle down on my passenger seat of my vehicle.  It rolled off and hit the floor.  The clear part cracked and split into two pieces.<br /><br />Thermos needs to replace the clear plastic part of the lid with something more durable or a plastic that isn't so brittle.  We have had 5 other random Thermos water bottles for over 5 years and have never had a broken lid from those.  Why is it we can't go a month without a broken lid from these?  Something is seriously wrong with the clear plastic part of the lid design.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend these water bottles.  If they fixed the lid and made it more durable, I wouldn't hesitate to give it five stars.  However, with the flaw, it is not at all worth the premium price they are charging.",[],B00E6O7CC0,B0789BHMHG,AFCSMOBFR3C6KH3VPSBAUVX5GHDA,1447919220000,23,False,Under Armour,Stainless Steel,Standard Bottle,Black Chrome,,532.323,0

1.0,DESIGN FAIL - my first disappointing Contigo,"At first I thought it was just me - that I was doing something wrong. But no - reading these other recent reviews on this newly re-designed water bottle,  I see that others have had similar poor experiences. The problem is that the lock set/release is a tab/lever that is located INSIDE (the underside) of the lid. When the lock is in place, it's true that the bottle does not leak - but it is also not possible to drink from it. You need to UNSCREW the lid, flip the lock off, and re-seal the bottle. That's simply absurd. Leaving the locked seal in the open position doesn't help matters any - you can take a drink, but turn the bottle upside down (or have it fall out of a side pocket on your pack) and it leaks like a sieve - in my case, almost creating water damage to my camera body. Contigo is a good company, that has creating many good products in the past. Unfortunately, this bottle is NOT one of those -  do not buy it. Go for a different design.

2.0,NOT FOR HOT LIQUIDS; only keeps liquids cold; it is leakproof,"I am INCREDIBLY disappointed because I ordered this for hot liquids because the Amazon description says ""double-wall vacuum insulated to maintain cold or hot temperatures.""  However, once I received this and saw the plastic / rubberized tip and a similar type straw, I thought there is no way this is for hot liquid. I was right. After reading the attached card (see first photo), it says this is not for hot liquid. I have so many cold liquid containers that I did not want another one. This is also expensive and is not worth the purchase for just a cold beverage container when it was a hot liquid container that was wanted.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it works very well for cold liquids very well. This comes in three pieces (reservoir, top, straw). The straw gets screwed into the top. The tip is pliable and has to be sipped with strong suction. My water stayed cold all night long. I did put several ice cubes in the container with my tepid water and it felt like it came out of the fridge after about 12 hours.<br /><br />In addition to its thermal properties, it is also leakproof.<br /><br />In summary, this is four stars as a cold beverage insulating container but zero stars for hot simply because the straw and tip are not suitable for that. Had this ""hot liquid"" incorrect claim not been made on the Amazon site (which is how all purchasers make decisions), I would have rated this 4 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CreOToHJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CreOToHJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CreOToHJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uvTxeHX4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uvTxeHX4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uvTxeHX4L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y-O+HcVQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y-O+HcVQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y-O+HcVQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07HGSDRNX,B0BYFKCBWM,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1552993937092,2,False,CamelBak,Stainless Steel,"Reusable, straw top",Black,"Carrying Loop, Straw, Leak-proof when closed",600.0,0

2.0,Has some fatal flaws.,"Wanted to love these bottles because they're so incredibly cute and they hold a lot for a child's bottle.<br />However, there are some fatal flaws:<br />You may be ok if you have all older children, but you'll have to decide for yourself.<br />1. The spouts can be bitten, cracked, torn very easily.  I have two children (4.5 yrs and 16 mos.). They have both cracked spouts by fidgeting, biting or playing with their bottles.<br />2. The spouts can fairly easily be pressed into the bottle causing it to POUR out water.  I found this out by giving it to my 16 mos. old in his car seat.  He pressed the spout down and soaked both himself and his seat allowing me the joy of removing the seat from the car to clean the entire seat because soaked cheerios and gold fish don't clean themselves.<br />3. Bottle is just a bit too large for our car seat cup holders. (Chico Nextfit). They do go in, but every time you lift the cup out of the cup holder the cup holder pops off of the car seat and then gets tossed in the floor making the car seat no longer have its cup holder. So I get to climb into the center of my van to retrieve cup holders and cups that have no holders after every car ride.<br />Just writing this review has convinced me to invest in new cups.  Off to continue the search for the perfect cup.  If you have suggestions I'd be happy to hear them.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IcQsvhxkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IcQsvhxkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IcQsvhxkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sC-MY17fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sC-MY17fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sC-MY17fL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B015DK93B8,B00PUDI2Z2,AHARWDOEUNRTMI542YMXT7AVCEHA,1497406930350,48,True,CamelBak,Plastic,"Reusable, kids, straw top",Iguanas,"Carrying Loop, Straw",400.0,0

2.0,Disappointed for sure in the straw lid,"I was super excited to get this bottle and I LOVE the color. My complaint is that the straw lid SUCKS!! It is very hard to drink out of with the straw, as the suction lets you only take small sips before the pressure builds up and you have to stop. Then the thing lets out an annoyingly loud noise, like every time you suck on it. It's the worst flaw.  Also, I drink a lot of sparkling water out of my bottle and tonight was the first time I tried doing this. I put the water in, allowed the carbonation to settle, put the lid on, and then took off for dinner. I came to a stop at a stoplight and went to take a drink. As soon as I popped the straw, a fountain of my water spurted out into my face, down the front of my dress and all over my car! This has NEVER happened with any of my other bottles with straws. I soaked up the mess and released the pressure by removing the cap. When it was settled again, I re-capped the bottle and continued to dinner. I pulled up to the restaurant and again tried to open the straw to drink.....another fountain in my face! I was PISSED. This bottle is not worth it if I can't have the drinks I want to have in it. The problem is that pressure hole is a terrible design. I have another awesome bottle that has a rubber stopper that goes into the pressure relief hole when you close the straw, but is a completely open hole when it's open. NEVER issues with any type of liquid until this bottle.

If only they made this part like their competitors and actually allowed it to screw in, this would be the perfect bottle.<br /><br />We ordered another bottle since my kid refuses to drink from anything else but we'll have to put up with this constant battle of making sure everything is lined up, every....single....time....he drinks. *SIGH*<br /><br />Please fix this so this bottle can be everything we hoped it would be!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816bZ--E8uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816bZ--E8uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816bZ--E8uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81w57f+5miL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81w57f+5miL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81w57f+5miL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07663TZNP,B01MPY2DBT,AFBM5W2IRT5RWK2A3MO6Q3HXDOAA,1607627916171,0,True,CamelBak,Blend,,Purple Swans,"Straw, Insulated",400.0,0

2.0,Hard to keep mold-free.  Bite valves need frequent replacement,"I liked this a lot at first.  It keeps water cold and is essentially spill proof. This is why I thought it would be an ideal product to keep water on my night stand.  No more knocking a glass over in the middle of the night and frantically cleaning up the spill.<br /><br />At first it was perfect, but the bite valve was full of nasties after a few days and had to be washed.  The problem is that after a few washings the bite valve will no longer stay put  and needs to be replaced.  At first I found a bag of 10 replacement valves at a decent price, but they were not made by Camelbak so the fit was imperfect and they fell off frequently.<br /><br />  The next time I needed replacement valves, I could no longer find that option.  The only alternative was a two pack of bite valves and straws for nearly $12, half of what I paid for the bottle.  I don't need to replace the straws often, so after buying a few of these sets they start to accumulate.  I wish Camelbak offered just the bite valves in bulk, considering that with daily use and frequent washing, they need to be replaced every few weeks.<br /><br />A more serious issue is that there is a silicon gasket on the nipple where the bite valve attaches.  Over time this has started to accumulate black mold.  I've tried soaking it in chlorine bleach and cleaning it with a bleach soaked cotton swab, but I can never completely remove the mold and it returns in full force after a month or so.  This gasket does not seem to be removable or replaceable and it is very difficult to clean.<br /><br />Note I have only used this bottle for water.

My original still works great with no leaks and I give 5 stars to my newer wide mouth 2 liter bladder.  But the Platypus soft bottle needs some of work.  First the good.  It makes a great camp bottle.  The 0.5 liter is perfect for having hydration nearby and the base actually spreads out perfect to allow the bottle to stand on it's own.  Now the bad.  The top does not screw on enough to insure it won't unscrew if packed away with fluids in it.  It needs more threads.  I think this is why SOOO MANY reviews say they received no caps.  They are lying on Amazon's warehouse floor cause they don't stay on.  Also the cap that covers the push-pull cap is IMPOSSIBLE to remove.  It has a smooth surface and NEEDS ridges or something to grip the surface to pull it off easily.  I ended up having to unscrew the top and drinking right out of the bottle.  This is a two hand job, since the softbottle will fold under the weight of it's contents if held near the top of the bottle, you need a second hand to tilt the bottom of the bottle up to drink.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GArIcE0lL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GArIcE0lL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GArIcE0lL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00A9A2LSK,B00A9A2LSK,AEOIRF55RTASMIVPMJP4N7LCHPBA,1471722360000,10,False,Platypus,"Polyethylene, Glass, Plastic",,Red,"Lightweight, Push Button, Collapsable",1000.0,0

1.0,This is the best kids cup we've found - amazing customer service,"This is the best kids cup we've found, and we've tried plenty. It's insulated, minimum plastic, straw is covered with silicone but has a hard layer beneath so kids can't tear it as easily as the camelbak or Foogo straws. The only caveat I have is the orange silicone piece over the straw comes off easily on the adult cups. For the children versions, it is a different lid in which the spout does not come off. Make sure you order the correct replacement lid if needed and do not get them mixed up when washing.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've been meaning to update this review. I will be buying these cups over and over. With two of these bottles, the bottom ring around the bottle came off. This is NOT supposed to happen. In googling, I found out that with this bottle, along with any other insulated bottle, a lead dot is used to insulate these. Naturally, I was pretty upset to find that they used lead in making a children's bottle, especially by a company that claims on the website not to have lead in the product.<br /><br />I contacted the company, and I have to say, their transparency and dedication to creating a safe bottle is impressive - and I am not being paid by them or work for them. They explained the inclusion of lead, and in looking at all my other insulated bottles, they indeed have the bottom lead dot, some covered by a metal ring to keep the dot contained. (Camelbak, for one, only paints over the lead dot.) Eco Vessel explained that they paint over it (as required by law) but they also contain the lead through a metal cover. The metal cover should not come off. I noticed that both of my bottles that had the metal cover fall off were sold by BT Group here on Amazon. The company verified that these bottles in question were NOT fakes, but they did have the same batch identification from 2015 on the bottom. (I do have another bottle with that same ID in which the bottom has not fallen off.) The company ended up sending me replacement bottles for free to make up for the ones that the bottom came off, AND they are changing their FAQs to explain the process they go to in order to make the bottles as safe as possible.<br /><br />In sum: If you own one of these (or any other insulated bottle) and the bottom falls off, do NOT use because there is exposed lead (that is painted over and supposedly not unsafe, but out of caution, I would not give it to a child.) Do NOT buy a bottle from BT Group here on Amazon. Purchase straight from the company on their website. Finally, continue to support this company. If you have any questions, contact them. It's nice to know there are still companies around like this, that care about their customers and their products' safety.<br /><br />Plus, both I and my kids prefer these bottles to any other we have tried, including Camelbak, Kleen Kanteen, LifeFactory, and many others.<br /><br />SECOND AND FINAL UPDATE: Please do not waste your money on these bottles. We had several, including those sent directly from EcoVessel to make up for those whose bottoms fell off, exposing the lead that keeps the bottles cold. Every single bottle has had the bottoms fall off. We have never had that happen with any insulated water bottles. We've had to throw them all away. All of my praise about the company caring about their product means nothing if you have to contact them each year to get replacements. We went back to the trusty thermos foogo/funtainers and those are much more sturdy for little kids. Still can't find the perfect water bottle with a straw for adults, but will keep trying.",[],B00MVLUI6W,B00MVLUI6W,AF6VWYHPUYOKOKNW5ET3RUJ2PMVA,1482160995000,44,True,EcoVessel,Stainless Steel,,Silver Express,,384.4555,0

Be aware that there are parts that are nearly impossible to clean. I assure you, if you have one of these bottles in your cabinet right now, use the end of a fork (because it’s nearly impossible to remove with just your fingers) to pry off the area where the vent leads to. This is a major design flaw and I’m so sad that we’ve been using these for 3 years and this area has never been properly cleaned. All 3 had sludge/slime in this area and the teal one was growing mold.

1.0,If you want to keep buying replacement tops this is the bottle for you!,I purchased this for my youngest Daughter who by the way goes through insulated bottles almost daily!  I needed something bigger than 12 ounces and was insulated so the beverage would stay cold all day regardless of the temperature.<br /><br />On the plus side...One handed operation for easy access drinking. On the negative side...The plastic top does not look like it will survive very long. My Daughter has dropped this and thankfully it has landed everywhere except the plastic top. If this were to take a direct drop/fall onto the plastic top I may be singing a different tune. The reason I am giving this only 4 stars is the price is a little expensive and like EVERYTHING from Under Armour and the plastic top.<br /><br />****UPDATED REVIEW****<br />I felt the urge to update this review. There is a fatal flaw in the design of the water bottle. The cap! I think the manufacture who sells this made it to break. If you are human you will have this bottle fall out of your hands or get knocked over. You better PRAY it does not fall on the cap. The cheap see through plastic breaks with ease. I went and purchased replacement caps and guess what? They broke too. I threw out the thermos because who wants to keep purchasing replacement tops!?!?

1.0,Creepy black plastic/rubber on inside! Do not purchase!,"ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY!<br /><br />I bought this to keep in my pocket for running and snowboarding. It always nice to carry less dense objects if you’re prone to falling like I am. I rinsed it with cold water upon receiving the item as it “seemed” really clean when I took the lid off to inspect it. No dust, no debris. Rinsed a few times with warm water and mild soap, shaking in between. Everything seemed perfect.<br /><br />Took it up to the snow, filled it with a Dasani water I purchased from a vending machine. Finished the day and went home, started unpacking the next day. Since there has only ever been WATER in this thing and only like a third of the 500 ml still had water and very little air, I was very surprised when the little black spots I could see wouldn’t rub off the outside but were in fact on the inside. Mold? Could it be? The bag hasn’t been anywhere warm and it would be a real stretch to say the water has sat for 48 hours. But maybe I thought? So I went downstairs, got the hotish water going and did the whole soap and soft toothbrush thing. Rubbed around for a little while litely, trying to get each inside edge. I would get the couple black spots that had bothered me, empty and inspect and then suddenly there were a few more black spots. Repeated the process a few times until I felt borderline crazy. Started rubbing my finger around in there and this weird, black plastic/rubber film kept forming around my finger like I was trying to manifest the creepy black haired girl from “The Ring.”<br /><br />I don’t know what’s going on here, but that little black film is very concerning for me. Especially with the amount of work it takes to try and clean it all off. The only saving grace is that I have the lime green one so the black film shows decently well under light. I’m not so sure about my black 8L pack, but when I decide how much I want to know if I’ve been drinking out of another product that sheds creepy plastic hair mold, I’ll update this. May just toss them both in the trash and try something new, maybe spend a few hours meticulously cleaning both of them sometime this weekend. We’ll see how I feel.<br /><br />Sorry about the photo quality, but it wasn’t easy to take a photo of the inside of the unit with my phone while trying to hold it in a way it was viewable. It’s more apparent to the eye than in the photo.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e2EJlNwKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e2EJlNwKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e2EJlNwKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B079NDHQKQ,B0BVYWXXVQ,AF4BDW2ZAPCCD7GSS2SZCTAM55OQ,1576534345151,5,True,Hydrapak,Other,,Mammoth Grey,"Filter, Lightweight",500.0,0

WHICH IS THE VERY REASON I BOUGHT INSULATED WATER BOTTLES!  I put ice water in the bottle and let it sit in the freezer for 15 minutes, then put my smoothie in it and took it to work for my lunch.

Of the three bottles I received, they were all much darker than shown in the pictures and are of masculine shades.  Being female, I don't like masculine shades.

This way the cap both looks and feels as if it’s screwed on tightly, but in fact water leaks out easily.<br />I wrote to CamelBak about this, and hope they know about the design flaw and recognize my damage.

2.0,Still has the smell issue.,"I bought this steel water bottle stein thinking that it is fully covered in the stainless steel that I should have no problems of smells getting trapped and no funny business growing anywhere around it. Especially it is advertise that it would not harbor any bacteria or smell.  But with the silicone ring insert inside the cap, I am getting the mildew smell of stagnant water when capped even after washing and drying,  I even read reviews and pulled the silicone ring from the cap. Gave it a good wash and dry but still, the smell from the cap still remains. I have even resorted to soaking the cap and the silicone ring in vinger and baking soda but it's still not 100% gone. Now washing these bottles is not easy. The main body is no problem if you have a brush washer. But the lid is the problem area. You have to have at least a straw brush to get into those crevasse not just a bottle brush.  I am also noticing that once you pull the ring out, be extra diligent when placing it back on.  If it is slightly crooked in any type of way (even to the naked eye it looks flushed in), your stein will be leaking its contents. I bought a total of three steins (one 40 oz, and two 21 oz) and the silicone ring on one is already starting to breakdown and all three have the same smell issue.  Now does this stein keep its contents cold as advertised? It does but in hot weather the ice melted within the 5th hour, so those reviews that state their ice was still there after the whole day must be using this item indoors. The wide mouth on the stein is nice but not so nice when on the move such as doing an activity or in the car, its very hard to drink from on the move. I read that healthy human will be releasing a sport top this year but nothing as of yet.  In review, it does smell, difficult to clean, does not hold water as cold for 24hrs as claimed, hard to drink from on the move.  So now I am back to looking for my perfect insulated water canister.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51r6QeyQtaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51r6QeyQtaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51r6QeyQtaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B019HFLHNW,B0BGM8TW2T,AFYIIILI6TIRPPSVMYEHVD4OHCZA,1469906403000,13,True,Healthy Human,steel,,Bahama,,470.0,0

And I wish it were 1/2"" shorter, because it doesn't fit under the automatic water dispenser in my fridge.  The trigger locking mechanism is very of hard to flip down when it's in the locked position; that's nice for a good solid lock, but not too convenient to when trying to get the locking mechanism released.<br /><br />I love the features they have added on this, which are not typical on bottles and solve problems.  The o-ring that seals the lid to the bottle has a tab to make it easily removable, which is great because you need to clean this every week to prevent mold.  The rubber piece that seals the cap to the drink spout is easily removable and fairly easy to put back in,  which is great because you need to clean this periodically to prevent mold.  The carrying hook nestles around the drink spout, so it is stored out of the way.<br /><br />The drink spout pops up well and is spring loaded (better than the rubber bands of the past).<br /><br />I have always loved the pour spout top, instead of sip tops or straws, because you can get a good mouthful without much work, which makes you drink more water.<br /><br />The bottle is very attractive.",[],B08TRGWDXW,B08W4K7TVN,AFGJTKDZHNGRNR67UIXPFPYJK3UA,1645126098713,0,True,Under Armour,"Polyester, Nylon, Polypropylene",,Breeze Blue,Durability,532.323,0

1.0,The 32 oz and 21 oz are same sizes. RIP off!,"I had the green one labeled 21 oz. Ordered the blue Glacier in the 32 oz size. Guess what? They are the exact same size. Same height and diameter.  What a RIP off. See pic. I even poured water from one to the other. The same size.<br /><br />Older review...<br />I guess I'm the odd man out here.  I ordered a bunch of these and the tumblers.  On this Healthy Human Water Bottle, I was used to Thermos-style insulated containers where you can sip from the lip.  There is nothing here in the description that indicated that you could sip from it yet there were so many rave reviews I thought, I'll order and figure it out.<br /><br />Well I got it and there is no port to sip from or hole for a straw.  You have to unscrew the lid and drink. For me that is not convenient at a desk or in a car as it becomes a two-hand process over the Thermos type containers that have a thumb flip or slight unscrew and drink. With this Healthy Human, it's lid all the way off or forget it.<br /><br />Next issue for me is I put in hot water and a tea bag at 8:30 a.m. and at 5pm it's still scalding hot.  It's great that it retains the heat, but heck, I will still get second degree burns to drink from it!  So I poured it into one of the tumblers but it quickly gets cold. Now I need two hands to unscrew the bottle and a tumbler...definitely can't have this in the car and on the desk, I have two items instead of one.<br /><br />Colors are great and a quality bottle but all the pretty doesn't help the function of drinking it.<br /><br />I would have given it 3 stars, but I went to the Healthy Human website to call them to see if I was missing something and there's NO PHONE NUMBER!  I never like dealing with companies that can't give a number.  I had to fill out a form, which I did and asked for their number.  Instead of responding with a number or a call to me, they simply delayed further and said, &#34;what is the nature of your question?&#34;  UGH.  So I went with one star.

2.0,Not what I expected,"I'm a single mom of 3, and thought these were a decent price for insulated bottles as They can be pretty pricy. I bought these for my twin daughters to take to school for snack time. They were very excited about picking these out. They just arrived this morning, and I'm so disappointed. The picture online isn't the same of what I received. The bottles are completely that soft plastic, which isn't a big deal. I just thought the harder plastic would be on the outside though, because of the pictures online. The designs look like they are just wrapping paper shoved in between the bottle and outer case, it's not cut to fit. The designs are wrinkled and messed up, and make noise when you squeeze the bottle. You can't even try to straighten it out. The bottles seem to hold water, as I did try that out before writing the review. Hoping the material that these are made out of actually keep the water cold, but it looks skeptical. I can't just return these, as I'd have to drive 45 minutes to an hour to the nearest UPS store, so it wouldn't be an easy return. I gave it 2 stars for holding water, if it actually keeps ttheir drinks cold, I may revise my review and add 1 star.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612FAMU3BzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612FAMU3BzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612FAMU3BzL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61q3hrX22AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61q3hrX22AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61q3hrX22AL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qUYy4PbqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qUYy4PbqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qUYy4PbqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tdW+YuKML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tdW+YuKML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tdW+YuKML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c0V-H+bgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c0V-H+bgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c0V-H+bgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0083VU5PS,B0083VU5PS,AHQSYYW6G4BHXDY22UIEZFXZAQIQ,1505144144229,3,True,POLAR,,,,Insulated,354.882,0

2.0,"Old Version Was Much Better, For Me At Least","I got this water bottle because I loved the old chute style by Camelback, but unfortunately this version is much worse, at least for me. It takes 2.5 rotations to take the cap off for a drink (as opposed to the very convenient .5 turn on the old model) so it just takes much longer and has an annoying feel, like what am I opening a jar of pickles just let me drink already! Then how the cap is attached and comes off is attached to the right of center (as opposed to be perfectly central on the old model), so you basically can't drink this with your left hand without the cap hitting you in the face repeatedly because you can't hold up the cap with one hand, at least not comfortably. So you basically need two hands to hold this and drink it comfortably, or use your right hand. Maybe a left hand version will come out later?<br /><br />I think this new version is more rugged than the old version, so I bet a lot of people like that who use it outdoors hiking or something. I think the new one may last longer based on the construction. But I just mostly use this while playing video games or in my house generally, and the old one I have is still very much going strong, I just wanted a back up/rotation bottle. The old version was a perfect combination of being able to get a drink quickly, holding it with one hand, and then putting it back securely so if it knocked over it wouldn't harm my electronics/computer. I hope to find the old version again (or at least the old cap/lid attachment) because the new one, for me, is way more inconvenient.

1.0,Updated review - GARBAGE AND DANGEROUS!!,"I think this is a great bottle and was just what I was looking for at the gym: great look, large opening to easily mix a pre-workout drink, nice grip, locking tip.  The only problem I had was with the tip.  I unlocked it once and went to pull it up to take a drink and the entire tip yanked right out.  I though it was broken but was able to put the tip back in, but now need to handle it very gingerly.  When I'm working out, I'm used to just yanking up the spouts on plastic water bottles, taking a drink and mashing it back down. Never had a problem with the cheap plastic version. I was pretty surprised that this one was so sensitive. (BTW, the cap and spout on this are plastic too)<br /><br />MY UPDATED REVIEW: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS DANGEROUS FOR USE AS A DRINKING BOTTLE. This is a piece of junk!  I've had this for less than a year and yesterdays, the entire baked-on plastic lining peeled of the inside of the body.  I was left with plastic shards in my fruit drink mix. This is not only dangerous but is grounds for a lawsuit.  There are now toxic pieces of lining coming off in the bottle and it is useless.  I will be contacting corporate at Amazon, since they sold it to me.  I have sent an email to SIGG and have not yet heard back from them. Someone will be refunding my money for this.",[],B003URRC0G,B003URRC0G,AEWX35VJ3HDYMXJZKGEGUGSUD6RA,1310661401000,7,True,SIGG,,,Dark Blue,Wide Mouth,750.0,0

2.0,Expected more for the price.,"The wife and I bought a pair of these to try to avoid the need to take out a second mortgage, which would be required to fund beverage purchases at our local theme park (Disney World). The idea was simple: Fill up at the fountain, and feel secure that we were drinking relatively clean cool water all day long.<br /><br />In practice, you swiftly find that you are drinking very little warm and relatively unclean water approximately once per day. The filter does very little if anything to filter out impurities, or even off flavors from local tap water. The insulation is ineffective at best. And don't blame it on the Florida sun. The bottle is held in a covered bag until needed, and the time between fill and drink is usually under 5 minutes (comes out of the fountain cool, out of the bottle warm).<br /><br />The bottle leaks. A lot. Additionally, for it's size, it doesn't hold as much as it should. Of course it's volume is stated in the description, but when you receive the bottle, it just feels like you are looking at the opposite of a T.A.R.D.I.S. It's much bigger on the outside than the inside. If that meant that my water wouldn't go from icy coolness to supernova in less time than it takes to imbibe, I'd be all for it. But that's not the case.<br /><br />This product gets 2 stars, mainly because the company backs it's products and I respect that. Sadly, you cannot replace a poor item with an exact replica of the same item and expect improvement.<br /><br />It may work for some, but not for us (And really, I'm not picky.

1.0,Cleaning issue ruins this product.,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Excellent concept. Poor execution. The CLEANING of these cups is what absolutely destroys this product. Even if you ONLY use water, open up the spout, run water through it, run it through the dishwasher, leave it open to completely dry and then close it back up, you will STILL find brown/black gunk all throughout the components. On the surface, it'll look clean. I challenge any owner of these cups to pull, lift, spread apart, open up...do whatever you have to do...to look beyond the surface throughout the lid/spout and you will be absolutely repulsed by what you find.<br /><br />I have purchased these on two different occasions. After the first issue with the brown/black gunk, I thought nearly a year later I'd give them another try, this time being extremely vigilant about cleaning them. Same exact result. I even decided to remove the small, round clear plastic thing that the straw pushes up against, as that is where the most visible gunk is found. Even then, there are still too many small crevices for it to build up. Under the little flap that protects the spout from dirt if dropped, there was slimy buildup. On the hard plastic and soft rubber pieces that are up against the straw opening in the lid, there was black/brown gunk. When you try to pull up the hard plastic spout (that's not removable), there is black/brown gunk where it comes through the other side of the lid. Oh, and if you try to clean and rinse under the spout and spout protector that clicks down, keep tilting the lid to get the water out. It will continue to run back under the plastic and won't completely come out. I held it upside down, and the dripping stopped. When I turned it right side up, more water would pool in the corners! I can't seem to figure out where the water is going, so I can get it all out.<br /><br />And to add insult to injury, the straw does not stay in place. It very easily pops out of the lid, which forces you to open the lid, push the straw in as hard as you can, and hope for the best.<br /><br />Finally, yes, it is described as a 'water bottle'. However, the only things mentioned in the instructions that came in my box were to not put hot or carbonated beverages in it. On their website, they add that you should not put pulpy or perishable liquids in them. Again, even with water, there is a cleaning issue. And they say it's safe to run through the dishwasher, but think about all of the food particles and gunk that are in your dishwasher water during the cleaning cycle. That surely ends up in some of these crevices.<br /><br />Very disappointing.",[],B009MLPSNC,B009MLPSNC,AFQ36VS2GRQ6QWPWUG24UEDJHZ3A,1414250950000,35,False,Contigo,Plastic,,Blue,"Spout Cover, Straw, Carrying Loop",414.029,0
2.0,"Cool concept, but has durability issues","My wife loves water bottles and just can’t seem to stop herself from getting more of them when she has a chance. This is how we ended up with this Contigo Auto-Seal water bottle. It’s a pretty standard Contigo bottle except for the lid.  The lid is the main draw of this water bottle… and its main drawback<br /><br />The lid boasts a spring driven push button drinking nozzle that is supposed to seal when the button is not pushed down. It makes for a really convenient water bottle, dispensing with the straw you see on a lot of water bottles.  There is a clip mechanism on the inside of the lid that pulls the mechanism back to allow for cleaning with a bottle brush. On the outside of the lid there’s a door that snaps over the nozzle for storage. All in all it’s a pretty cool gimmick that makes the water bottle really convenient to use.<br /><br />My wife really was a fan of this bottle until it started to leak on her. The autoseal mechanism stopped sealing all the way and it would dribble down her shirt as she was lifting it up for a drink. Maybe it’s a weak spring or worn plastic.  Either way, the bottle’s inability to seal properly basically has sent it on a one way trip to the recycle bin. A quick check on Amazon shows that we are not the only ones with this issue.<br /><br />I can only suggest that Contigo go back to the drawing board and test their products in real world scenarios before releasing a product that lacks the durability for regular use.

Overall I am very happy have a container to drink out of that is not plastic and is large enough to use throughout the work day without having to replenish.<br /><br />Update: So it seems the place on the stein that was not fully coated produces some sort of odor.

2.0,Irremovable plastic residue - or beware the blue,"I have four of these bottles. They help keep my hydrated at work to allow me to sip throughout the day and before I know it, I've refilled the bottle three to four times each day while at work.<br /><br />I purchased a couple more in order to keep a rotation of clean ones. I already owned one purple and one gray one, so I bought a red and a blue one. I had no trouble with any of them except the blue one. For no reason other than wastefulness (at least for online sales) each bottle comes wrapped in a thin plastic which is (usually) removable. There is scoring to rip along the bottle to make this simple. However; the blue bottle's plastic clung to the container in a  percentage of its surface area. In some cases, I was able to remove the plastic after several laborious minutes. However, most of this stubborn plastic refused to budge, would shear away a fraction of its thickness, or would leave glue residue. This leaves the entire container unappealing and in some parts sticky. I have attached pictures of multiple sides along with a comparison that shows what it should look like.<br /><br />The above is my main complain; I am hoping a representative will contact me.<br /><br />Assuming you do not have this trouble - the bottle is very good. I do have some complaints about the lid somewhat. Occasionally when I refill the water (to approximately the 20oz level) I experience a slow leak out of the straw if left open - even undisturbed on a level desk. Tilting it can allow a torrent of fluid to escape the straw. This either does not affect all of my lids or it is random. This has on occasion left me with either a wet desk or wet paperwork. Once the liquid is below a certain level, this doesn't seem to be a problem.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KwWgz0AFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KwWgz0AFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KwWgz0AFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Oj9+e9iaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Oj9+e9iaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Oj9+e9iaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SjEnF-DHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SjEnF-DHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SjEnF-DHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jX9GoJS5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jX9GoJS5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jX9GoJS5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ds5QC-28L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ds5QC-28L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ds5QC-28L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0043TEHG2,B0047GL1A6,AHEM2Y3RHGZ5HBPWKRY5IOHT5N7Q,1577572364198,6,True,Nalgene,Tritan copolyester,,Clear,"Leak Proof, Push Button",560.0,0

The first flight my bag was soaked - not just a little damp, but the about half of the bottle emptied out into the bag because the seal of the rubber pieces couldn't hold up to the pressure.

You don’t get much water with each drink! Not what I am wanting out of a water bottle!! As you can see by the photos, the spout opening is oblong now instead of round like before! I would not recommend the new summit cap at all now!

After dilligent care for about a year and a half, and only using for water, mold is indeed beginning to grow under the mouth spout where it can not be cleaned.

It keeps our girl's water cold, does not leak, and is easy to clean. Seeing all these reviews about mold, I can't help but wonder if people are cleaning their bottles properly. We have never had an issue with mold. Follow the care instructions that come with the bottle and you should be a-ok.

2.0,"Bottle Is Great, Top Not So Much!","I like Nalgene bottles generally, and bought two of these in green and two in blue.  The bottles themselves are great, absolutely no complaints there.  However, the tops of these definitely leave something to be desired.  I purchased these not that long ago (alas, return window is closed though), and over the weekend one of the two pieces of plastic that holds the cap on the lid broke off (see pic).  The one on the other side is cracked (see other pic) and will do the same very soon I'm sure.  All of this despite having been properly cared for and not dropped etc.  Even with one side still attached, the cap no longer fastens so it's just sitting on top of the drinking spout, not actually doing anything.  I'm not really sure what is the point of a water bottle that can't close and keep the water inside.

My only complaint is the mouth tip.<br /><br />So far so good and no mold in sight. We have been super diligent about drying this out each wash and haven't had an issue with mold. YET.

I was originally told my post did not abide by Amazon guidelines, and I dare say it's because I stated the item was not eligible for return. I had to contact customer service, who kindly refunded my purchase. However, suffice to say, the return process for this item is not as smooth as others. It does not say on the listing anywhere that it can't be returned. The opening on this bottle is very hard to drink through. I increased from my original 1 star rating to 2 stars, as my husband pointed out that the difficulty in drinking makes it pretty leak proof. So if you have a younger toddler who doesn't mind not getting much liquid, then this is for you. I was hoping to use this to send to school for our older child.<br /><br />Original review:<br />My kids can barely get any liquid out of them. I tried to return and was told it is NOT eligible, despite being purchased through Prime. I couldn't find anything on the listing showing that it could not be returned. Contacted customer service, awaiting a response. Still rating 1 star for lack of &#34;drinkability.&#34; Sure, it may not leak, but my kid will die of thirst before he can get enough water out of it.",[],B001NCDE2A,B001NCDE2A,AHMCEP6RIP46UOJQZ6UGLJZAMWYQ,1499652935000,8,True,Nalgene,Aluminum,,Blue,"Leakproof,Wide Mouth",350.0,0

I’m not superman and I wasn’t gripping that strong. A well made, well insulated bottle should not flex in your grip. This metal is very thin and probably only one layer. Not good for insulation.<br /><br />Another issues is the paint starting to chip already. I bought the stainless steel and blue pair but have mostly been using the blue one so far. Just light use, bringing it to the office, setting it my car cup holder, going golfing. Nothing that it shouldn’t expect to do. But in just a few weeks the bottom is starting to chip paint off.

It is with great sadness that I write this review as both of my water bottles have failed now and I am so incredibly sad. My 24 once bottles top seal in the lid has failed so that bottle leaks and my 40 ounce bottle won't keep my drinks cold and is now having condensation on the outside on the bottle making it hard to grasp (but quickly that changes as my drinks turn room temperature very, very quickly!)

1.0,"Cheaply Made, breaks easily","UPDATE: we have had these for a very short time, I ordered three within the last few months and now all of the spring loaded closures have broken and popped off since that time. These were good when they worked but now they can’t be used as a shaker cup because there’s no closure on the lid. Save your money and buy a cheaper, regular tumbler because once these lids break (and they will do so quickly) they just simply become an overpriced but cheaply made tumbler.<br /><br />We like this cup. I ordered a few that I use for iced coffees in the morning and we’ve been washing all 3 (two 20 ounce and one 12 or 16 ounce, can’t remember at the moment) in the dishwasher since we purchased them. 2 of them seem to be holding up wonderfully but one of them had the parts to the spring loaded lid closure pop off after dishwashing for a few weeks, so it’s no longer what I would consider a shaker cup, because it doesn’t have the automatic spring loaded closure when you pull the straw out. That being said, it still works great for an iced coffee cup and I would purchase again. Also worth noting that we have the sort of dishwasher that scrubs off crusted/ baked on food and you’re not even supposed to wash food off your dishes before putting them in.

1.0,Will not last you long,"Initially, I loved this water bottle, I live in AZ and wanted a water bottle my kids could take to school and stay cold all day. It did great at that. The insulation of this is amazing. I could leave it sitting out all night and it'd still have some small pieces of ice left in the morning. My daughter took it to school with her ever day and loved it. But of course, kids being kids, she dropped it a few times. Every time she dropped it, it started to leak a little bit more until finally I had to throw it away because it'd be empty by the time she got to school.<br /><br />After that, I purchased the exact same bottle again thinking maybe it was her, that she was rough with it and did something wrong. Not even a month after she started using this one, she dropped it once and the same problem, it broke and started leaking all over. The problem is the ring around the top where the lid connects. While the rest of the bottle is metal and seemed well made, this one piece they made out of plastic and didn't seem to do a good job at that. It looks like 2 pieces of plastic that were fused together. And when she dropped it, those 2 pieces split and cracked so easily, it ididn't last her long at all.<br /><br />If you want a water bottle like this, do yourself a favor and buy a hydro flask. I have since bought one of them for each of my kids and that is a quality made bottle. Every part of the bottle its self is made of metal and the insulation has been working for us even better. It may cost you a few more dollars, but for that you will get a much more quality product that will last you a lot longer. Wish I had learned the first time my daughters water bottle broke.",[],B009ZX0ZCG,B009ZX0ZCG,AGGSAEYOFRAYXHCGEYNWUMAYC5YA,1471401326000,10,True,EcoVessel,Metal,,Girl with Heart-White,,384.4555,0

Previously, I had been<br />using a 32 oz. Bubba cup to carry my water.  I have noticed that I am<br />running out of water more frequently and not drinking as much water. The<br />real problem is when refilled with cold tap water, the water is not as cold<br />unless more ice is added.  Ice does not last 24 hours even in the house<br />with air conditioning.  All of this is not so much an issue when I am at<br />home, but it is when we're out traveling or just running errands. Should we<br />have gotten the 32 or 40 oz.size? Would the larger size keep ice longer?<br />We really like the fact that the Hydro Flask won't spill with the Flip Top<br />closed.

2.0,Not worth the loss of capacity compared to the 0.75L!,"I love the CamelBak Chute bottles, but this is really not worth it.  You are better off just getting the 0.75L bottle and having more liquid.  Since I first used the bottle, I thought that it wasn't really working that well for an insulated bottle.  I'd spend an hour or so at the gym and come out to my car where I left the bottle and the water would barely be chilled.  That's a tough case to make because cars can get fairly warm and it has been 75-80°F here in MN.  I decided to perform an actual test so that I can convey some real results that support my claims.<br /><br />I took 4 bottles:  1) insulated 0.6L CamelBak Chute  2) 0.75L uninsulated CamelBak Chute  3) ~0.6L Hydro Flask stainless vacuum bottle  4) ~0.6L Klean Canteen stainless vacuum bottle<br />-I filled each of them with cold tap water that I left running for over 30 seconds.  This water was 48°F when it was put into the bottles.  I then put 4 ice cubes into each bottle and secured the lids, turned em over a few times to mix it up.<br />-I left the bottles sit on my kitchen counter for 1 hour.  I had the air conditioner on and the room temp was about 70°F.  No exposure to the sun.<br />-After the hour was up, I shook up the contents to try and help get a consistent temperature reading.  The 2 stainless vacuum bottles are the only ones that still contained any ice and the temperatures of the water in the bottles as follows:  The insulated CamelBak (1) was 49°F, the uninsulated CamelBak (2) was 53°F, the Hydro Flask (3) was 36°F, the Klean Kanteen (4) was 35°F.<br /><br />I realize that there could be flaws to my test, but it also seems pretty basic.  I took roughly the same volume of water that was the same temperature and added the same amount of ice cubes.. let em all sit for the same amount of time in the same environment.  My insulated CamelBak does not appear to be damaged in any way.  There is/was no condensation on the inner part of the bottle or anything that would indicate atmosphere inside rather than vacuum.  After sitting for an hour, the insulated CamelBak was only 4°F cooler than the uninsulated one.  I'm not even sure that I could tell the temperature difference of the two if I had just opened em and drank from them without taking a temperature measurement.<br /><br />IMO, if you are actually looking for a bottle that will keep your beverages colder for longer, you are way better off with a stainless vacuum bottle.  My example bottles, the Hydro Flask and the Klean Kanteen actually rate their product to keep beverages cold for 24 hours and hot for 6.  The CamelBak website does not even appear to have a time rating for their insulated bottle to keep beverages cold and it also does not mention keeping anything hot/warm.  These stainless bottles hold the same amount of liquid at the CamelBak in question and they are both smaller in size.  Other than thinking this looks like a cool bottle (like I did), I really don't see why anyone would buy this.. knowing what I know now of course.  It's a larger bottle than the 0.75L, that holds less liquid and doesn't really keep it much cooler.  Depending on the color you choose, it could be almost twice the cost of the 0.75L as well!  Of course my stainless bottles certainly weren't cheap, possibly 3-4x the cost, but they are far superior as this test shows.<br /><br />I saw one bullet point that commented that this bottle reduces condensation.  While it may be true that it's less condensation, in my experience, this bottle is covered with condensation when I pull it out of the fridge on a humid day just like any other bottle.  My vacuum bottles do not sweat at all.<br /><br />On a positive note, it has not leaked at all.  Also as previously mentioned, I love the Chute lid, just not this particular bottle.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FlWhDnCUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FlWhDnCUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FlWhDnCUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00O0UVB40,B00O0UVB40,AESXJ4SZK2NGWTBG3CD2MUQRNSCQ,1464145843000,21,True,CamelBak,BPA-Free,,Fire,Insulated,600.0,0

1.0,Parents Beware! Defective Bottle Production!,"This year we transitioned our youngest child out of the smallest Klean Kanteen bottles into the 18 oz size, which is the same size our oldest son uses. I have ordered three total of the classic bottles in the coastal waters color from Amazon this year.<br /><br />We have had several dozen bottles from this company over the years, including the thermal coffee ones my husband uses. I use the 27 oz classic for everyday use in and out of our home. All these years, the classic bottles have held up to many “drops” … all receiving their fair share of dents, but still being completely functional. These new bottles I ordered are NOT made like the others. Last week, I was cut by a sharp edge on the outside of one of these new bottles. It had an obvious dent on the bottom … like every other bottle in our home. BUT this dent was very different with cracks that seemed to separate the exterior or the “coating” from the interior. I put the bottle into recycling, not wanting my seven-year-old to also be cut.<br /><br />Last night, I witnessed my son drop another of the new bottles on our wood kitchen floor. (He’s seven, so the bottle fell from about 2 1/2 feet off the ground…not very far.) Again, a dent resulted with CRACKS unlike anything I have seen in any of the other classic water bottles.

1.0,Expensive Junk,"After having read the glowing reviews on these, and being a customer with 9 regular Klean Kanteens, I decided to get the insulated kanteens (in fact I purchased 4).  I was a little worried because there were some reviews that noted that the insulated kanteens leak, but there seemed to be so many others that reported that they didn't have this problem, so I decided to take the plunge and purchase these.  BOY, am I upset that I did.  It appears that if you put hot liquids into the kanteens, they leak like crazy.  They only work with cold liquids.  With each insulated kanteen averaging about 30 dollars each, I just threw away $120.  I bought 4 because my husband and I like to bring coffee and tea to work.  For the first 2 weeks, they were fine and did not leak.  But then after a while, they leaked like crazy.  I had to wrap each bottle with a paper towel and then but the bottle into a ziploc baggie in order for it not to ruin on work bag.  All 4 have leaked.  By the time we get to work, the paper towels are soaked with coffee and tea.  I complained to Klean Kanteen bc I was just so upset after having spent 120 on these bottles.  They asked whether the rubber ring around the lid is still in place -- yes, they were for my lids.  Then, in a follow up email, they stated that it is unlikely that the bottles would leak if the gasket (rubber ring) is still in place -- UM, ok.  Thanks for telling me that I'm not experiencing the problem that I am actually experiencing with your product.  They then want you to spend your own money to send the bottles back to them so that they can &#34;evaluate&#34; the problem.  Totally a waste of time and money.  Customer service on this was also useless.

1.0,"Update - not BPA free! Good bottle, but one major design flaw","Unfortunately had to update my review to 1 star because it is not BPA-free as described. The description states that it is, however the code 7 on the bottom. This might not matter for some people, but as a pregnant woman, that’s something I want to avoid. Disappointed in the inaccurate description and wish I had realized it sooner.<br /><br />Really like this bottle and no leaking so far. I like that there is a switch to lock the auto seal button when needed.

2.0,"Decent soft flask, but difficult to close","I use this bottle with my Salomon 1L running vest. As soft flasks go, it is okay. I prefer the types of flasks which have a larger opening, as it makes it easier to clean, but the wide mouth really doesn't serve the kind of purpose to which it is typically put.<br /><br />The most significant issue is that it is very difficult to close - to secure the lid you have to apply significant twisting force to it and the bottle,, but the only surface you have to grab onto on the flask is the collar right under where the flask threads on, which is of course flexible. If you grab lower, then the squeezing pressure forces the water out the top of the flask. You can tighten it, but it takes several seconds and some technique, whereas on any other bottle it is maybe a second and practically zero effort. The collars on the official Salomon flasks (ASIN:  B07V7J8R8F) are approximately elliptical in shape and a little stiffer, so you can get a solid grip, and the caps go on as easy as any other bottle.<br /><br />The second issue is how it fits into the vest. In a Salomon vest, the circular lid doesn't really fit well - it protrudes awkwardly (in terms of how it feels and how it looks) from the top of the sleeve, and it only gets more awkward as the water in the flask decreases. It fits, but not as well as the official Salomon flasks, which have that oblong collar and narrow cap, which has no such issue.<br /><br />So this is okay for a generic soft flask, if you want to keep it in your pocket or bag and collapse it when it is empty. Much more convenient than hard plastic bottles for that purpose.

2.0,Downgrade from older designs.,"I live with my water bottles, and I'm loyal to one. It goes with me to exercise, follows me on walks and hikes, joins me on drives, and even goes to bed with me at night. My daughter is the same way. But she left her bottle out by the chicken coop we were building and the puppies got it, just like they got a couple of chickens who jail-broke the previous coop. So here we are.<br /><br />First impressions of the bottle just out of the box is, ""Ya nice quality! And it's CamelBak!"" And that's the point when everyone rushed to Amazon to leave their reviews... And this is a major problem with people leaving reviews on Amazon. There should be at least a 1 month waiting period to review an item. You know, so you have at least some idea of what you're talking about.<br /><br />I find this bottle awkward. This is not for cycling unless you're the type of person who can tie a knot in the stem of a cherry with your tongue. I definitely have to to stop and use both hands to negotiate the cap.<br /><br />The hinge is stiff and limited to to a 2 o'clock(ish) position. I don't like being told where to put my cap.<br /><br />The magnetic lid wont stop it from leaking so you'll still need to screw it down anyway.<br /><br />The chute and cap are too deep for a single hinge, so you're left with a contraption that has two bending points. One to elevate the lid high enough to come off the chute, and the other to flip it back to the predetermined well where it will be magnetically held open.<br /><br />So all these seem like nitpicking until you got your heart rate up to the 180+ marker and your mouth is dry and you need to snatch some moisture from your bottle real quick. That's when the fun begins.<br /><br />Water bottles are just given away all the time, so to drop $30 on two that are counter-intuitive is bleh.

In both cases, it's really easy to tear it or poke a hole in it, rendering the suction for drinking a noisy, slurpy, moot point. REALLY bad design.

I've loved their durable, easy to wash, easy to drink from bottles for a long time.  I bought THREE of these two pack EDDY+ Kids bottles for my children (six bottles total).  My kids loved them IMMEDIATELY and I thought I had been liberated from baby sippy cup hell.  A few days after the bottles arrived, one was dropped (my kids are under 35"" tall, so it wasn't dropped far!!) the bottle cracked and I assumed it was just bad luck.  A few days after that, another cracked bottle,.....  so I researched the Camelbak website to see if there was anything I could do to have them replaced.  The site clearly states bottles are NOT replaced for damage (which is totally fair, but unfortunate since the bottles were so new).  After two bottles broke, I bought silicone ""cups"" for the bottom of the bottles hoping to protect them from breaking.  Unfortunately, my idea didn't work and two more bottles have broken.  So we have only two bottles left and I don't see them lasting very long since four bottles broke in less than 30 days. My kids are NOT rough with things, they never threw or abused these bottles.  I have dropped my Camelbak bottles MANY MANY times over the years and have NEVER had a problem.

The new mouthpiece is kind of a pain to put on and doesn’t stay put (see photo attached). Have already lost one.<br />3. The straw still doesn’t stay in place, like the old bottles, if anything, it’s worse<br />4. Two of my 3 bottles are leaking from the lid.

1.0,Edit: BROKEN - Great water bottle that eliminates bottle sweating!,"Update 12/5/16 the flexible rubber straw (it is barely visible inside the cap of the water bottle) that connects the bite valve mouth piece to the hard straw inside the bottle seems to have sprung a hole and now when you go to suck water up it gurgles and bubbles and barely pulls and water up.

I work in a building that has water fountains water that tastes bad to me, so it's great to have freshly filtered water - it really makes a difference in the taste of the water. Also, I really like how the bottle is insulated so that it won't sweat - keep in mind here that it's not insulated to the point where it will keep a beverage very hot or very cold for long amounts of time, but in a humid area like where I live, even chilled water will cause your water bottle to sweat all over your desk which is terrible. This water bottle's insulation eliminates that and I love it!

2.0,Bad design for young children,"My toddlers love drinking from my CamelBak bottles, so I bought them their own version. I was excited to get these and so were the kiddos, but we were quickly disappointed once we started using them. The design of the lid and bite valve on the adult bottles make them almost impossible to leak or spill beyond the occasional few drops left in the top of the valve. I was hoping for the same thing on the kids version. Unfortunately, the bite valve on these does not fit over an attachment in the tip of the lid like the adult version. Instead the valve pushes into a hole in the lid from underneath. This means that the valve can be knocked or pushed back into the bottle from the top very easily - creating a large hole for liquid to pour out of. The first time my daughter dropped hers, the valve popped loose in this way and a whole bottle of liquid poured over the kitchen floor. My son later managed to poke the valve back into the bottle and pour his entire bottle on the couch! Good thing it was just water! These bottles seem sturdy otherwise. I'm going to put them away and probably try again when the kids are older. Even then, I would be careful about it.  It's a shame they didn't think the design through a little better for the price.

Please see the pictures, one from the listing with a red circle around the spout where it appears to have a large opening, and the picture looking down the throat of the bottle that shows two, very small openings.<br /><br />Because of the very small openings, filling the bottle without removing the top section, is slow and and contributes to spillage if you are going quickly.  It also takes a lot of time to empty the bottle, and I didn't even have the container full (in the video).  For a water bottle of this size (25 fluid ounces) I expect to be able to drink the entire contents in less than 10 seconds.

1.0,[Update] IT LEAKS!  TWO WAYS! (and 16 ounce size is really only 15 ounce capacity),"6/19/19/ Update - The lid comes loose and lets it leak!<br />So after coming to grips with not being able to trust the snap closed part of the lid to not leak (see prrevious update), I have also been having problems with this cup being a dribble cup - I'm trying to drink coffee from the lid hole, and coffee drips from somewhere else, inevitably on my blouse at work. WTF!  I think I figured it out, at least.  After my kuerig brews into the cup, I put the lid on snugly.  Sometime later, heat from the coffee has either spread out more, or maybe it has dissipated, but the result is that something has expanded or contracted so that the lid is no longer tight.<br />So now I find myself continually checking whether the lid is still tight so I don't drip coffee on myself.  It's not worth the effort and anxiety!  I'm going to toss the hot drink lid and see how it fares with cold drinks through the straw and therefore don't require the cup to be tilted.  What a waste of money this purchase turned out to be!<br /><br />10/31/18 Update - This cup LEAKS!<br />I fill the cup with hot coffee.  I correctly screw on the hot drink lid and ensure that the closure is fully engaged and should be sealed.  My expectation is that as I carry my full cup of hot coffee to my car, I should not have have to be compulsive about keeping it perfectly upright, because sealed lid, right? WRONG!  Several times now this cup has let small amounts of coffee out through the (sealed)  lid somehow.  The first time I thought I just did not have the lid closure fully snapped into place.  But the problem persists.  Not happy.... Not happy at all!  Since I've never done anything but gently handwash this thing, I am perplexed that such a costly cup should do such a poor job of not leaking.<br /><br />Also, the purported 16 ounce cup is really only 15 ounces. If that is important to you (like if you want to be able to pour a 16 ounce drink into it), you need to know!  As full as I could get it was 15 ounces with either lid. If you don't like your drink to touch the lid when you put it on, it's more like a 14 ounce cup.

1.0,REALLY disappointed with the current one I bought.,"I don't know what they changed in their insulating process but these are no longer the champs of keeping hot/cold liquids hot or cold.

Ice and water stayed ice and water for up to 3 days and hot liquids stayed uncomfortable to drink for a full day. But I recently moved and those 4 are in storage so I ordered this new black one. The new one won't keep ice and water for more than a day inside an air conditioned home. I tested the previously purchased bottles by putting ice and water in them and then put them in the front seat of my car that was in direct sunlight, during the summer, and 90% of the ice was still there by the end of the day.<br /><br />The only good I can say about the currently purchased one is the quality of the build.

I clearly should've paid better attention to some of the poor reviews on here. This model also leaks. It can't be trusted in your bag or anywhere it can't sit upright.

1.0,MOLD- when I thought I found the best cup ever.,"I absolutely agreed with all the 5 start reviews until now. This was my kindergarteners favorite school cup. She used it every day. I cleaned it every day. I noticed upon cleaning it this past time, that it was no longer closing/opening right. I was jiggling pieces, trying to figure out the problem. Turns out,one of the plastic pieces holding the spot had broke. I also noticed a black spot on the silicone that I hadn't noticed before. I cleaned it with the nope brush like I normally do and decided upon relaxing this cup- with the same one of course, that I would just have to be sure to clean it better that I thought I was already doing.<br />Went back to amazon to find another. Decided to take a quick look at reviews- because I intended on leaving a good one, even though mine had broke. Saw where someone had taken there's apart and found mold. I decided to do the same after seeing the black spot.<br />Low and behold- MOLD- where it is impossible to clean. Between the two pieces that are screwed together. I'm appalled. Do not use this cup.

2.0,"Exactly what I was looking for, but didn’t deliver on all features","I bought the 32oz Lunar bottle. The good is simple. Packaging is simplish, comes with two straws, it does a phenomenal job at keeping cold liquids cold (which is one big reason I bought it), and it’s big enough for me to keep track of how many times I’ve filled. But small and light enough when full to not be overly heavy. Even more so when you use ice, and looks nice.<br /><br />The downsides are big for me. It says engraved, it is not. It instead has the black coating nearly perfectly cut and stuck to the bottle. Not a big deal, but it’s a big reason why I chose this one, for the word “engraved”. It also is not leak proof. My car seat was the unfortunate victim to make me notice. It falling over and me watching the water slowly come out as its on its side confirmed it. Which means instead of just throwing it in my bag when I leave the house (I now have to carry it with a hand I’d rather be holding onto a railing), and when I get into a vehicle of any type it has to stand upright. Defeating yet another big thing that helped me buy this bottle: no leaking. Sucking through the straw is also hard unless I 1) loosen the lid to always have an air exchange or 2) I push the little nub of silicone down a bit as I drink. I don’t like either option, as I don’t want it to have yet another way for it to leak if it happens. It was also shocked but not really surprised at how easy it is to dent. It was dropped from a height of about 3ft, on an industrial grade floor mat for fatigue (super soft and bouncy) and it has nice dent RIGHT on the rounded edge of the bottle. Not a deal breaker, I expect it’d happen regardless but not like that.<br /><br />I don’t consider it not being dishwasher safe a factor as I went in knowing it’d have to be hand washed anyways because my dishwasher isn’t tall enough for it. But that could be a factor for others. Despite the bad I am still using it as my two other options are a still cumbersome yeti tumbler or buying plastic water bottles for water. Both of which are worse for obvious reasons.<br /><br />Still the leaking problem is huge and really ruins the rating value or recommendation.",[],B07PKLNHVR,B08SQC83XC,AEMBPSNXPZLS7W2EOOG6E4BALYCA,1615881123560,22,True,Simple Modern,Stainless Steel,,Ombre: Tropical Seas,"Leak Proof, Insulated",946.352,0

1.0,Not thrilled,"Honestly I read all of the reviews before purchasing this but there’s a few things people didn’t mention. This water bottle is slippery to the touch, because of the material it’s made from. Unless you have Velcro hands it can be dropped easily. It also doesn’t fit in a cup holder which is super annoying to me. I don’t think anyone said that. It does however keep things really, really cold for a long time. For someone who is active and drinks water all day, that makes me happy.<br /><br />As far as the cover- it’s inconvenient. And then they wanna charge another $16 for a different top? It should come with several options. I’m a mom of 2 and I have a newborn, it’s difficult for me to have two hands available to open something.

5.0,Great for Short Runs,"I usually don't take a water bottle on runs 6 miles or less but with the weather warming up, I needed something for hydration. This bottle works perfectly for keeping me hydrated in warmer weather.<br /><br />I have several Hydrapak water bottles so I knew what to expect with this flask. First of all, these can have a weird taste at first. I've found putting a little lemon juice inside and letting it sit and the rinsing it out really good helps. This has a bite valve which keeps water from leaking from the spout.<br /><br />The strap makes carrying this bottle a lot easier. The insulation on this flask is what I like most about this bottle. Though it doesn't work to keep bottles super cold on a warm day, it does keep my water cool for at least 30 minutes. The only drawback with using this hand held flask it that if I use it everyday, I notice my shoulder starts to hurt from the little extra weight. I have to keep rotating which hand I put it in during my run. Otherwise, I don't have anything else I don't like about this. This is a higher quality flask that some of the others I've used so the price point less than $30 seems reasonable. I don't think I would pay more though.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810iKWKU94L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810iKWKU94L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810iKWKU94L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R9cDfY65L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R9cDfY65L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R9cDfY65L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hntZccd1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hntZccd1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hntZccd1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08QF2F3W9,B09VCTXSFF,AHX42Y3TATT7ODX5TNIFTS3VKAHQ,1617975159505,2,False,Hydrapak,Other,,Silver,"Leak, Insulated, Carrying Loop",500.0,1

5.0,The winner among water bottles for us,"We have owned the Kleen Kanteen, Sigg, and CamelBaks, which are among the more popular choices.  All in all, I think the Kleen Kanteen is the winner.<br /><br />WEIGHT:  The Sigg is probably the lightest, but none of them are terribly heavy.  ADVANTAGE:  NONE<br />LOOKS:  The Sigg is probably the most attractive, with cool patterns and customization options.  The CamelBak is pretty ordinary clear plastic (or stainless) as is the Kleen Kanteen we have.  ADVANTAGE:  Sigg<br />MATERIAL:  The Sigg is Aluminum with a coating (and they tell you not to leave liquid in it long term), The CamelBak we have is Plastic, and the Kleen Kanteen is a stainless:  ADVANTAGE:  Kleen Kanteen, DISADVANTAGE:  Probably both the Sigg and CamelBak, unless you get the stainless one<br />DURABILITY:  The Sigg seems to dent a bit easier than the Kleen Kanteen.  We have never dropped the CamelBaks, but are careful about that as they are plastic.  ADVANTAGE:  Kleen Kanteen<br />LID QUALITY:  Love the lid on the Kleen Kanteen, hands down.  Well built.  ADVANTAGE:  Kleen Kanteen<br />EASY TO DRINK FROM:  Kleen Kanteen, hands down.  The Sigg is fine, but ours just had an opening that easily spilled and leaked.  The CamelBak is not bad but our kids complain they have a harder time sucking water out of it.  ADVANTAGE:  Kleen Kanteen<br />EASY TO CARRY:  All three have a carry loop:  ADVANTAGE:  None<br />EASY TO CLEAN:  The Kleen Kanteen and Sigg lids seem easy to clean.  The CamelBaks are more difficult to assemble and take apart, and the plastic suck spout is tough to clean without a small baby bottle brush (the kind with the nipple cleaning insert).  Even then, too much work.  ADVANTAGE:  Kleen Kanteen and Sigg<br />LEAKS:  The Kleen Kanteen leaks the least, by a long shot.  Our Sigg leaks all the time as does the CamelBak unless you are really careful about screwing the lid on. ADVANTAGE:  Kleen Kanteen<br /><br />Overall results:  Kleen Kanteen - 6 points, Sigg:  2 points, CamelBak - 0 points... But I'd put the Sigg in third place because they are aluminum with an epoxy lining... and they used to have BPA but did not disclose.  I don't trust Sigg.",[],B002MQ2CJC,B002MQ2CJC,AEZ7XOPLPIDM4DLKWQPND46PGODQ,1313207676000,1,False,Klean Kanteen,Aluminum,,Indicator Red,,354.882,1

4.0,The lid is both good and bad,"I wish I had known before I bought this that you cannot disassemble the lid for cleaning. It has screws and springs and moving parts that are part of the push-button spout that you simply can't remove. It also feels weird to me to have your drink running through a mechanism rather than simply a spout or straw. See attached pics. In case it's not obvious, this makes it unusable for anything but water, e.g. juice; to be fair, it is labeled as a water bottle but in my experience it's not unusual to use a water bottle for other things. Other than that, it's a nice-looking bottle, is a good size, is easy to use and doesn't leak, can go in the dishwasher and is BPA-free, so I'm giving it four stars overall even though I would not buy another one.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YkJJ+rtFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YkJJ+rtFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YkJJ+rtFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fwSvk7qQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fwSvk7qQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fwSvk7qQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zWLmQvKFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zWLmQvKFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zWLmQvKFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00OTOKR1A,B00OTOKR1A,AHAJIGJF5RUNKPO2THDYF6CD37VA,1474770231000,10,True,Avex,Plastic,Standard Bottle,Barbados,"Dishwasher Safe,Straw",473.176,1

5.0,Great little bottle,"My son loves this. He used to drink (aka backwash into) my CamelBak water bottle, but he is now so proud to have his very own water bottle that he rarely asks for mine anymore. We bought this for him when he was 14 months. He's always been good with a straw, so grasped the bite valve technique easily.

5.0,"Excellent upgrade from previous bottles, works for hot/cold, dishwasher safe. Colors as PICTURED.","I'm a water bottle obsessive, with literally a dozen different types for different uses. When Contigo stopped making my favorite plastic bottles, I literally panicked as they've proven the most durable and versatile of any other kind. (I turned to Avex, which is no longer in business). The same can be said of my preferred Contigo metal bottle, which kept water cooler than any competitor. (I loathed the Yeti lids, so no thanks.) Both of these bottles starting eventually leak, which is to expected after several years and thousands of refills.<br /><br />The Chill 2.0 is the best of both these bottles, arguably Contigo's best bottle to date. The metal is so much lighter then previous (albeit more apt to dent), is longer and sleeker (cup holder friendly) to allow 24oz, the bottles can hold hot AND cold (although I'm sticking to cold to not wear done the seals on the lid), and the lid is redesigned to be of a natural feel (and less rounded). Finally, the lid is dishwasher safe, and has the flip/spring option to get into the most grimy parts.<br /><br />Yes, these aren't as fancy as other bottles out there in presentation, but at $15 each for this two pack, they're a steal.

5.0,"Tougher than I expected, lightweight, and freezeable.","This bottle needs to be washed often, but it is built tough and can be frozen.  I've been testing it with daily use and travel to some other cities (it is VERY nice to have a water bottle that takes virtually no space in my daybag), and now that I am comfortable with relying on it I am going to buy several more for hiking and camping.  This bottle weighs between 1 and 1.2 ounces (the manufacturer says 1.2, my scale seems undecided so maybe 1.1) and has survived several drops and falls.

5.0,These are great design with a few key notes that makes them ...,"I just wanted to put a review in this bottle. I am someone who has always had my insulated bottles. What made me want to buy two of these was the fact that I take a hot coffee to have for all day and I could attest that I have put my coffee in this in the morning around 600am and still have hot hot coffee all morning when I want some of it. It is still hot in the afternoon also and by the time I'm am coming home is still warm. I do fill it with hot water to warm the bottle and dump it out before putting my coffee in it. I fill the other bottle with ice and fill with water. I take a separate bottle with me in my work bag and refill it all day long. Has still had ice the following morning. These are great design with a few key notes that makes them better then previous bottles. The lids are made very well and have metal that goes down into the bottle. Makes a good deal with the gasket at top of inside. The other is that it is one solid piece of metal from the outside to the inside making the double wall vacuum seal solid without and weak spots. Which would be where the creases meet making others less effective. The opening is big enough to put any normal size ice cubes in it. There is also lifetime lid and gasket replacement if ever needed.  The outside coating on the bottle is very tough and doesn't chip. I take these with me every day and have now retired my two previous bottles that I had. Which there was nothing wrong with, these are just better bottles overall. The hot water inside the bottle to warm it before filling it with hot coffee has ensured that I have very hot coffee all morning to sip on when I want it. It is worth the money spent and I bought two. Black and cinnamon. I paid 29 for black and 25 for the other which I actually really like the color also",[],B00YIVHKUA,B0BGM8TW2T,AGAWVVYZPOSADPBLIRCFCBDMH2WA,1492813872000,1,True,Healthy Human,steel,,Bahama,,470.0,1
5.0,Best personal water bottle I've ever had.,"I love this water bottle! It is easy to carry, I use this bottle every day--all day. I take it everywhere. I never have to worry about it spilling if it tips over. It's a good size; not too big and not too small. I think the bottle portion is easy to clean.  It keeps my water cool for a long time. I like not having to suck on a straw to drink.<br />I'm going to talk about some downsides now but nonetheless, I give this 5 stars.<br />The cap has complicated mechanisms in it that make it difficult to clean. Many of my water bottles in the past have gotten mildew in the caps over time and have had to be thrown out. They were less expensive and while annoying, it wasn't a big loss to replace it.  HOWEVER, I LOVE this bottle and if it gets mildew in the cap, I will be heartbroken to have to throw it away. MANUFACTURER: please make replacement caps!! I'll buy two right away!<br />Another downside is that the stainless steel bottle makes a bit of a clunk sound when I set it down especially on a glass table. Easy fix--I put a beer can cozy on it and now it's perfect.  OK, I found a pretty one the same color as the cap and it's really beautiful.",[],B01N6K88FQ,B0BTHXPZWZ,AHCKDD52FTSP46MATP35NKIBRUHQ,1519269069661,2,True,Contigo,Stainless Steel,,Steel & Monaco,,709.764,1

5.0,Happy repeat customer!,"This is my 4th Healthy Human (HH) purchase. I have owned 2 of the 16oz steins, one 20oz tumbler and now this 32 oz/950ml stein. I actually ended up bringing the 2 smaller tumblers to give to relatives in India who found that the insulation quality was far higher than any comparable products locally. They were in brand new condition, despite having been used for about 6 months at that point.<br /><br />This particular purchase was an impulse buy - I noticed the 32oz tumbler in pink was significantly discounted and decided to purchase. I also own a couple of hydroflasks and kleen kanteens (generally regarded as some of the better brands available) in similar capacities and I find that HH tumbler provides equally satisfying quality. The powder coating feels very similar to Hydroflask, thicker/more durable than Kleen Kanteen. I hand wash all my water bottles, so they see similar wear and tear. After about a year, the Kleen Kanteen has some small dents and paint chipping near the mouth, the Hydroflask has some minor dents but no paint damage. My HH cruizer has no damage.<br /><br />Another benefit of this tumbler that, if you are particular about your beverages touching plastic, the inside of the HH lid is lined with 18/8 stainless steel, keeping your drink from making contact with the plastic in the lid.<br /><br />Finally, I am very impressed with the customer service at HH. One of the smaller tumblers I first purchased arrived with a leaking cap. No matter how I tightened it water ran down the sides. After reaching out to HH, the promptly dispatched not 1 but 2 replacement caps! Very impressive. I have never had an issue with the leaking caps since the, but am confident that the customer service backs their products 100%.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything changes, but so far I'm really satisfied with this brand and their customer service overall and feel confident that this product will withstand many years of usage.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s0s3EGDML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s0s3EGDML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s0s3EGDML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01F7LAQN2,B0BGM8TW2T,AHVVC3WLMDJRWMMZ2Z2TDJ2PQDCQ,1548021607678,3,True,Healthy Human,steel,,Bahama,,470.0,1

4.0,Good bottle with flaws,"So I ended up getting one of these bottles to replace a smilar width wide mouth bottle. This is a step up in my opinion. It has a smaller opening that is easier to drink from, it is easier to open one handed, and the opening isn't threaded so you don't have to worry about spilling due to threads collecting water. There are flaws, however. The latch on the flip top is neither durable nor secure. It slowly wears so it doesn't latch as well, and is easy to pop open anyways if you aren't gentle. I have thrown this on its side on a car seat only to find it popped open and dumped water all over the seat.

I like how it opens with a quick push button, and the locking mechanism is easy to use.<br /><br />My one annoyance is that cleaning can be difficult as it has a longer shape, so it's really not possible to clean the inside past the first few inches with a regular sponge.

5.0,Glow in the dark is an extra plus!,"My boyfriend was looking into getting a Nalgene bottle (he kept talking about how good Nalgene bottles were) and we found that the 32 oz had a glow in the dark one! I'm a sucker for weird, unique items so that stuck out to me but I didn't want that big of a size so that is how I stumbled upon this one. I was afraid this size would be too small but it's actually perfect for me. Having this is great because it is small (fits in my purse perfectly) and easy to wash and refill.<br /><br />I always end up wasting a lot of water bottles because I would only drink half and then the water would sit around for awhile, thus ending up smelling weird and thrown away. This little bottle has been excellent because NO water has been wasted (I constantly refill it with one of those water pitchers or water machines at work). When I first received it, my boyfriend shone his bright flashlight on it and we tested to see the glow-ness. It doesn't glow very bright and the glow doesn't last long but I still think it's cool. My coworkers saw it and a bunch of them asked me where I got it and if I could order some for them or their children.<br /><br />I also like how it feels very sturdy; the loop that connects the bottle to the lid and the bottle itself. I always carry it around by the loop, which is the perfect size to fit a finger or two into.

Dishwasher heat will destroy the seals bc of the heat and don't really clean a straw.  I occasionally pop off the seal and clean under it. It's easy to see the part between the straw and where you pop the leak stopper in too. I use a pipe cleaner dipped in dish soap occasionally here too. I've had no issues and was actually coming to buy more bc I'm tired of trying to wash the one I have all the time lol!<br />Bottom line,  if you want to put it in a dishwasher,  you don't want any type of leak proof cup.

Bottom cloudy on inside after 1yr.,"Overall, pretty happy.<br />Bought this and three others over a year ago, and used for water kept in fridge.<br />The bottoms have clouded from the INSIDE over time!<br />Whether its from our water (minerals/floride) or crystal light (1:4 mix), I don't know.<br />The flavoring is meant for a single water bottle but instead mixed with 2qt water in jug then poured into water bottles.<br />They are ALWAYS filled, (on side in sink,) or in dishwasher.<br />Speaking of dishwashers: have had to be sure the strap/lid doesn't slip through wires where rotating washer hits it repeatedly. LOVE the strap holding on the lid. Super durable.<br />We don't usually use any ice, but they are excellent for that.

5.0,"Sells itself, literally.","I've had this bottle for about a few months, and there have been about 5 sold since them based on people seeing it and immediately needing to have one. This bottle works great, and the reason I purchased this one rather than the others out there is because of the metal layer on the inside of the cap. I bought it to keep tea in and it works EXCELLENT for that purpose. Before I go to sleep I make 2 cups of hot tea and fill the 32oz version to the top. When I wake up the tea is still steaming hot and literally the exact temperature I like to wait until it cools down to to start drinking. I've done this many times and it's just the same every time. An additional bonus is I've never had this thing leak on me, even a few times when I didn't make absolutely sure it was solid tight.<br /><br />Another random detail is the insulation goes all the way to the rim of the opening, so if you're drinking something hot the metal around the lid will never get hot where your bottom lip touches on the outside.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say about it, and this is more in the idea of the design rather than the product itself, is the cap is warm to the touch when I keep tea in it overnight while the rest of the bottle is room temperature. It is obvious that a lot of heat escapes through the cap, so what is the issue with designing a cap using the same vacuum sealed technology as the bottle? That would make this bottle go from amazing to absolutely perfect. If you make one, send me a couple free ones for the idea!! :)",[],B00YIVJUYY,B0BGM8TW2T,AHTI3CU77BXKQJYMTTVOQZ6SKCZQ,1453104967000,6,True,Healthy Human,steel,,Bahama,,470.0,1

5.0,"Good with leaks, wish it didn't wobble","Compared to other stainless steel water bottles I've owned, this one is the best so far.  Does a great job at not leaking, even when you get a little water on the part where the cap screws on which was a failing of my previous water bottle.<br /><br />You can drink one-handed which is a huge plus.  Other bottles claim to be one-handed but still have a cap to unscrew and tuck away which can be a hassle when you a driving - but not this one, just push the button on the back of the cap and you can drink as much as you want.  Also it pours, compared to other bottles with straws that make you suck the water - I much prefer the pouring type, the sucking type make me feel like a gerbil.<br /><br />It fits in any cup holder I've tried so far.  The diameter of the bottom is exactly 3"".<br /><br />Easy to clean - there's a couple of pieces to remove from the cap when you wash it, one of which is very small and easy to lose though I've managed to not lose it thus far.<br /><br />I did spot one area for improvement, and this has been a problem on every stainless steel water bottle I've owned and was actually the reason I replaced my former bottle for this Contigo bottle.  You are going to eventually drop this on a hard surface.  When that happens the bottom of the bottle will become dented and the bottle will no longer sit flat.  I wonder if Contigo couldn't come up with a cover for the bottom, maybe hard rubber or something similar, that could prevent this.

I wanted something lightweight that I could easily attach to my belt bag and store away when empty. This thing is SO lightweight that I wasn't sure it would even hold up; but it did! The material is shockingly durable. Its very compact and folds up super small so that I could even put it in my tiny fanny pack when it was empty. The hook attached to the top made it easy to loop around my bag and carry it around. The top is very durable as well and I didnt worry about it coming open or leaking even when running around and dancing all day.,[],B08QF19PKZ,B0BVYWXXVQ,AHCK62SMED4C2CCZGRAPT2Q2BPRA,1672760878036,5,True,Hydrapak,Other,,Mammoth Grey,"Filter, Lightweight",500.0,1

On a rare occasion they would do the same if I left them in a warm (not hot) car. That is not necessarily a complaint though more something to consider when traveling via plane. My kids have a tendency to bite more than needed on the bite valve and they tear after a while, which causes leaking as well. One thing I couldn’t figure out so far is that for some reason sometimes the bottles make a really loud sound when you drink from them and my assumption is that air gets into the straw and it makes loud “farting” sounds.<br />I have tried hydroflasks and for some reason they smelled funny, even though I cleaned them and wasn’t a big fan of contigo either because it was hard to drink out of them.",[],B07MM5NCBC,B07MM5NCBC,AG5UJB2MF34AOWG34JMFH6W6MBSQ,1579379877545,1,True,CamelBak,Medium Density Fiberboard,,Dino Skeletons,Straw,354.882,1

5.0,I cannot think of any cons at the moment so I'll just list the reasons I really like this water bottle,"First impressions review since I just got it today and haven't had the opportunity to test it out or see how it fares over time (although if the other reviews are any indicator, it probably does just fine).<br /><br />I cannot think of any cons at the moment so I'll just list the reasons I really like this water bottle.<br />1. Ample size: This water bottle is one of the largest water bottles you can buy and I love it. Most are around 16 or 20 ounces while this one is 32. You won't be refilling this thing too frequently.<br />2. Solid build quality: Everything from the strap to the plastic of the bottle to the cap feels solidly built with quality materials. You don't feel like there are weakpoints in the bottle.<br />3. The cap has a springy cap opening system where you press a switch and the plastic cap on top flips open. I was actually quite suprised it did that and it's not a feature I see on many water bottles. If I were Embrava, I would market that feature more because it isn't common and I didn't even know the water bottle had it until it arrived (although if you are familiar with the company, you might have already known; I am willing to bet, however, most people browsing Amazon are not already familiar with Embrava bottles). I actually almost broke it by just trying to pull the plastic cap open instead of pressing the switch so caution there.<br /><br />I was a bit confused on something that came with the bottle which was this small packet with two rubbery plastic pieces in it. The plastic pieces seem to go in the plastic cap on top to maybe provide some suction and prevent leakage and these plastic pieces seem like spares to replace the ones already on the bottle if/when they go bad. That might be it but I have no clue.<br /><br />Anyways, good bottle. If you want something well made and large, this is perfect.",[],B011LC85PM,B07CM8GLN9,AFQMA57YAF2RUOLTRWTBHRUEMANQ,1464737316000,0,True,Embrava,Plastic,Standard Bottle,Gray,"Leak Proof, Lightweight, Flip Top, Lockable Lid, Shatter Resistant",946.352,1

4.0,Read my review before deciding to buy,"I previously gave this exact model a five star review after I bought it two years ago. Since then I’ve bought three more for myself (one for a spare and the other two still brand new and stored for future use) and I’ve bought several others given away as gifts because this has been my absolute favorite from the dozen or so bottles I’ve bought since becoming environmentally conscious and giving up single use plastic bottles I used to buy by the case. So earlier this month I was reading the reviews and one got my attention about finding mold inside the cap. The caps have many nooks and crannies and impossible to see everything in there so I got my powerful flashlight and shined it into the two caps I use interchangeably. Holy cow! Mold in both! The regular bottle brush I use couldn’t reach down into the caps so I used one of those tiny brushes used to clean silicone/stainless steel straws. Yup, chunks of mold came out. I can’t begin to say how grossed out I was. Enough to throw those two lids away. After the excessive scrubbing they both started to leak from the mouth part anyway. Still love the bottles though. Now I use each cap (from my two new bottles) for only a day; wash it thoroughly in sudsy hot water and let it air dry completely. I’m pretty confident that’s the way to avoid mold. I just can’t give these bottles up. The size and how the cap functions is perfect for my everyday water needs especially away from home. I’m gonna keep buying them. I think the two moldy caps started to leak because of the excessive scrubbing which caused the plastic around the mouth hole to wear down so it couldn’t keep an airtight seal anymore.",[],B01N7LKY1F,B0BTHXPZWZ,AH3D57AJBPHM2FTN6CD3DZUVJ6XA,1514668937515,0,True,Contigo,Stainless Steel,,Steel & Monaco,,709.764,1

Drop a half of a tablet in the 500ml bag, let it soak and it cleans and sanitizes it. Rinse well and you're good to go.

5.0,Only use liquids that are easy to rinse out,"The ""wide mouth"" is nice for filling without spilling, but the lid is not a squeeze-bottle top it is just a screw-on cap.  It is very durable plastic, available in several colors and sizes.  This particular one (36 oz) is too big for a standard bicycle bottle rack but great for backpacking or camping.  It also has volume markings up one side so you can see how much is in it or how much you've been drinking.<br /><br />The wide mouth top is NOT wide enough to fit a whole hand into, and the bottle is too deep to reach the bottom with your fingers, so cleaning may be an issue.  Use a bottle brush!!  Only use regular dish soap and warm water, any stronger chemicals will eat the plastic.  Failure to use soap and a bottle brush will allow algae and bacteria to grow in the bottom corners of the bottle, which will make you sick if you keep drinking from the bottle.  So keep it clean, wash it every few days at least!!  Also try to avoid filling it with any sticky liquids that leave a hard to clean residue, like milk or cola.  It might be fine to mix up a little bit of Koolaid or Propel Fitness Water or something similar though.<br /><br />Bottom line:  durable plastic bottle with a plain screw-top cap, volume markings on one side, and a wide mouth to accommodate using a bottle brush to clean it.  Good choice for backpacking but might require an extra wide bottle rack to put it on a bicycle.

5.0,"Great, solid bottle.","I got the 22 oz teal model, I like the matte finish which is less slippery.  It doesn't sweat, and when the 'straw' is closed I am not getting any leaks even when shaking it vigorously.  Since i have a darker color the exterior can get a little warm (but not really hot) in the sun, but the contents remain cold as desired.  Also, this fits nicely in my bike's water bottle rack and car's cup holders.  Everything feels nice and solid, I have no worries about the quality of materials or build.  I've had it for over a month now.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it is that I have to draw pretty hard on the 'straw' to get water to come out, which makes me think the air intake hole is either too small or somehow blocked.

(They invariably developed leaks after a few flights.) I used my old Nalgene for a while, but it was a little too big to fit easily in my bag and I never loved drinking from the threaded wide-mouth.<br /><br />This bottle perfectly solves all of those problems. It holds plenty of liquid (750ml or just over 24 oz). It opens up wide for filling and cleaning, but has a small, smooth drinking spout that's comfortable and easy to use (no water dribbled all over me anymore!). As long as you screw everything closed tightly, it's totally leakproof, and because it doesn't have any valves or anything, there's nothing to &#34;fail&#34; under the altitude rigors that I put it through regularly.<br /><br />It's nothing fancy, but this water bottle is well designed and durable, and perfect for frequent fliers.",[],B00EPGMJ36,B00EPGMJ36,AEG4F37AHJXIIXJTRUZJMKTE6VGA,1459346348000,1,True,CamelBak,BPA-free Eastman Tritan,,Orchid,Leak-proof,750.0,1

5.0,Best all around waterbottle,"I am a cup/mug/waterbottle addict. I have too many to fit in one cupboard. Chances are, if its a travel/to go cup from the last 10 years, I have one. I have Yeti and Ozark trail, I have Contigo and Camel Bak. Its my go-to impulse buy. I found my first nalgene bottle at a thrift store. $.75 for a 32 ounces water bottle in my favorite color. It's got a lot of scratches, but I found my holy grail. So I came here and bought another. I fill both up with water and ice in the morning and then just throw them in my bag and I have drinks for the whole day. They never leak, I throw my bags around, they roll all over the back of my car and the front of my ambulance at work. Fire scenes, hospitals. These things have seen it all and they don't crack or chip or anything. The one I bought brand new doesn't have any scratches at all. It's not insulated like my yeti and it doesn't fit in my cars cup holder, but other than that, these are absolutely perfect for my day to day life. A side benefit for me is that if i drink both my waters and a full yeti, I fulfilled my target water consumption without having to really think about it. I love these.

4.0,Nose Hits Lid When Drinking,"The Contigo AUTOSEAL 32oz Water Bottle is well made and like all Contigo stainless steel water bottle products it will keep water with ice cold for 12 hours or longer.  The spout and air vent seal whey you release the sip button so if you accidentally tip the bottle over it will not leak and it even has a lock on the sip button to make sure it does not get accidentally depressed when you are carrying the bottle around.  It also has a cap you can flip up over the deinking spout to keep it clean and it even has a carrying loop that you can flip up from the cap to make carrying the bottle easier but it does have a few design problems.  My primary complaint is when you are sipping from the spout your nose is pressing into the lid.  Not a comfortable feeling.  The older Contigo ""West Loop"" water bottle design is much better for drinking out of but as far as I know it does not come in a 32oz size.  Another nit is the diameter of the neck which is straight.  Be better if there was a little flair in the neck to make the bottle easier to hold onto if your hand was wet.

It's also very large and not easy to clean even with a long bottle brush. However, those are the ONLY downsides. This is a very good bottle. It will fit in no cupholder known to mankind, so be prepared for that.<br /><br />The cap can screw into place, but if you're not transporting it, you can leave it unscrewed and the cap ""sits"" on the drinking hole very nicely to keep dust and stuff out of your water between drinks. It's a really nicely designed system that makes it easy to pick up and pop the top and drink while working or exercising without having to unscrew the top every time. Just don't forget to screw the top in place before moving it. 20oz is a lot of water to lose all over your new carpet if you forget. :)<br /><br />It's not as big as some of those ridiculous 100+ oz water bottles that seem to be en-vogue these days - those are just ridiculous.

5.0,Excellent Slender Vacuum Bottle with Press to Drink Button,"This is a tall relatively small slender diameter vacuum bottle often confused with the trademarked term Thermos™ Bottle.  It is 11 inches tall and just a little under 3 inches in diameter.  It holds 24 ounces of liquid. That’s about 3 measured cups of water, not a coffee mug.  Most coffee mugs hold about two cups of water.  Be sure to scroll down to see my temperature versus time chart.<br /><br />This vacuum bottle fits in the cup holder in the center console of my late model Honda Accord quite easily.  It sticks up about 7 inches above the cup holder.  It says it has an automatic shut off valve, but it would be more accurate to say it is a press to drink valve. You can press the valve button and drink the contents with one hand albeit a bit awkward in the car since it is so tall.<br /><br />So the following chart will give you some idea of its ability to keep the contents cool.  I keep my refrigerator at 38° F and keep a lot of bottled water inside. I put this vacuum bottle in the deep freezer at -8° F overnight, so this contributed to a good start, but longer term, it didn’t contribute much for very long. You will notice that the warmer the water becomes, the less the temperature changes per hour.  That is because the water is getting closer to the outside room temperature of 75°.  So there is less temperature difference between inside the bottle and the outside.  So there is less temperature differential between inside and outside.  Eventually the inside and outside temperature will become virtually the same – given enough time.<br /><br />Starting Temperature:  38.1 degrees F.<br />42.8° after 3 hours…..… Gain of 4.2°<br />45.1° after 5 hours…..… Gain of 7.0° Overall<br />46.2° after 7 hours…….. Gain of 8.1° Overall<br />48.9° after 9 hours…..… Gain of 10.1° Overall<br />52.5° after 12 hours…… Gain of 14.4° Overall<br />55.7° after 20 hours…… Gain of 17.6° Overall<br /><br />I haven’t tried this vacuum bottle with coffee because I’m not much of a coffee drinker, but I do like to sip ice cold water in my car for even relatively short trips. So I did a temperature test to test how well it keep the water cool.  The test was done with an ambient temperature of about 75 to 76 degrees in my house, so that is a fairly benign temperature environment.  What I learned is I will need to add some ice to keep the water temperature low enough for my preference for ice cold water.<br /><br />So if you are starting off with very hot coffee, the temperature change will be faster than the chart above would indicate – because the coffee temperature compared to the room temperature will normally be much greater. Unless you are storing this vacuum bottle in a hot car in August, that would be the case.  The rate of temperature change is a direct correlation between the inside and outside temperature difference.  The greater the temperature difference, the faster it will heat up or cool off the liquid inside.  It’s just physics.  The bottle materials and overall construction do have some to do with how fast this occurs, but these days, the concepts are well understood and there’s not a huge difference in thermal design. However, lid designs do have an impact on thermal gain or loss.",[],B01N7LKY1F,B0BTHXPZWZ,AGZC734FUDTRUS54AWY5NO7XHCIQ,1490293218000,0,False,Contigo,Stainless Steel,,Steel & Monaco,,709.764,1

5.0,Keeps you hydrated,Who knew that having a Camelbak would keep me so much more hydrated. I haven’t had a water bottle CamelBak before recently but since I was young I have been an avid hiker and have always had one of the backpack ones with the long straws. There is something about the straw that makes me want to take a sip more often than when drinking from something else. I work at a front desk so the backpack Camelbaks are not an option. That’s why I love these so much! I tend to drink about three of these bottles worth of water during my 8 hour work day which is way more than I used to drink. It carries a decent amount of water but it’s not too heavy when full. Super easy to wash with a detachable rubber straw tip. Big opening at top which helps when filling it up with ice. Strong loop at top where you can attach it to a carabiner if so desired. I’ve had mine for about 7 months and I’ve been using it every day. The only thing that has happened is the end of the straw that’s supposed to lay back down on top of the bottle is stuck in the up position. Very VERY minor problem when considering the rest of the bottles features. I’ve dropped it multiple times while I’ve had it and there have been no problems at all with leaking. All in all a super great choice!,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TlZMhuELL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TlZMhuELL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TlZMhuELL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01LA8AMVM,B01LA8AMVM,AGZ333ZGVNSBBWDC5S5E7KN6ANIA,1561130757525,0,True,CamelBak,100% Nylon,,Limeade,Bite Valve,1000.0,1

4.0,"Good, but I like the old version better","I purchased this set of water bottles to replace an aging set of Contigo water bottles that I totally loved but have worn out from continual use.  The new bottle is on the left in the picture (rose colored).<br /><br />My 4 star rating is biased towards being compared with my old water bottles.<br /><br />I like a wide spout so that I can get my water quickly, the spout on my old bottle is 1-1/2 inches ID (inner diameter).  The spout on this is 1-1/8 inches ID, so I can't get the water as quickly.<br /><br />The seal on this set is very good, though the spring to open the lid isn't strong enough to open the bottle when the air pressure inside is lower than outside, such as when going down in elevation (frequently traveling between 3,000 ft and 6,000 ft elevation) or when the liquid cools and causes a slight vacuum.<br /><br />On the flip side, this bottle can splatter water all over when the air pressure in the bottle is greater than outside.  I like filling my water bottles with as much as possible and with the smaller opening on this product, the water pops out as the lid is opened.<br /><br />The cap release is not as convenient as the old model.  The old model I press the release and the cap opens.  This version I'm still figuring out because sometimes the cap doesn't open until I release the trigger.  Sometimes I have to use my other hand to get the cap to open.<br /><br />With this model, I usually have to use two hands to close the lid because the design doesn't accommodate my hand with simple one hand closing.<br /><br />A feature of this new bottle, that my old one didn't have, is the locking feature.  I have a habit of dropping my water bottles and the old ones now pop the cap off and spill when dropped, which was one of the reasons for looking for a replacement.  I haven't dropped the new bottle yet, but I feel confident that the cap won't pop off when locked.<br /><br />My ideal is to be able to use one hand to retrieve from the center console while driving, open the cap with one hand, get a quick drink, close the lid with the same hand and return the bottle to the center console, all without taking my eyes off the road or being distracted with getting a drink.  This water bottle doesn't meet this criteria.<br /><br />Note:  This model, Contigo 2144909 was suggested to me by the Contigo customer service when I called asking what they have as a suitable replacement.  The representative was very helpful, even though the suggest product isn't as nice as the old one.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RJSxTbIXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RJSxTbIXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RJSxTbIXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rrIuNTnbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rrIuNTnbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rrIuNTnbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08RSM89VY,B0C8K5NRS1,AHS4PQ46V3MKWDPCKXIAPH3XLHGQ,1643813190431,28,True,Contigo,Tritan Plastic,Standard Bottle,Juniper & Pink Lemonade,"Dishwasher Safe,Leakproof",709.764,1

5.0,I love these flasks,"I now own five Hydrapak products including two of these Stow 500ml. They're all super light, durable as can be, and the taste has never been off for me.<br /><br />A few people like to complain that the lid cracks easily. It doesn't. Those people just don't know how to screw on a lid on. These flasks have a cap that's made of hard plastic with a good size thread. If the threads aren't lined up properly and you force it, of course it's going to crack from the pressure. It's not like a milk jug where you can just keep screwing and it will pop into place and right itself. If the lid isn't going on super smooth, you're not lined up.<br />Simply back off and try it again until it's right. You'll know when you are properly lined up because the lid goes on super smooth(which is more often than not). I've never needed more than 2 or 3 tries and that's just because you'll be holding it at a weird angle given the bottle's lack of rigidity.

5.0,Great product and helps me be Eco-friendly !,"I travel a lot and like to have water at all times. I noticed that I was constantly buying water at airports and hotells and sometimes not finishing the bottle completely which was a waste of money and was adding to landfill waste. I started looking at water bottles online. Things I was looking for were: Size (not too big bc I needed it to fit in the bottle pocket on my backpack and I didn't want it to be heavy), Condensation (or lack thereof), Style, Size of Opening, Leaks and size of spout.<br /><br />The size of the bottle is perfect. It fits perfectly in my North Face backpack bottle pouch. It also works really well in the water dispensers that are starting to be pretty common in airports nowadays. It also fits in most hotel ice machines so I can fit up the bottle with ice so I can have cold water. I do worry that it might fall out if I bend over so I just use the strap to buckle it in through the handle at the top. Since I keep my laptop in my backpack, I wanted to make sure the bottle would not have condensation. This bottle is insulated and I don't have an issue with that. The size of the opening is wide enough to work in ice machines and my ice maker in my refrigerator at home. The mouth spout is soft and angled which makes it easy to drink out of it.<br /><br />The cap is an easy half twist on and off which makes it very easy but you do have to make sure you have shut it correctly. I have thought I shut it correctly only to find out that it was spilling. It's just that I need to be more conscious about it.  Like other reviewers, I find it hard to guide the cap into its holder but I just use my finger to hold it out of the way.<br /><br />I'm really glad I bought this bottle. I have saved probably $50 in just one month by carrying this bottle with me while traveling.  I've owned other  Camelbak bottles in the past and trust the brand and this one didn't disappoint. I tell all of my co-workers about it so they can buy one and save $$ and reduce waste.",[],B00O0UVACI,B00O0UVACI,AERXUXM2EPURP7ZPR2NW2XQAHOUA,1471790816000,0,True,CamelBak,BPA-Free,,Earth,Insulated,600.0,1

I think I'll be happier with this after the toddler phase so I'm glad I have it on hand.

The straw is not long enough for the bottle! This makes no sense to me, as it's impossible to drink the last inch or so from the bottle.<br /><br />For toddler ages, I've had better experience with Playtex cups with straws, but happy I have this one too, as it's different and useful and my son likes to drink from it.",[],B015DK93B8,B00PUDI2Z2,AGWXVJQNXZWGOI6AE7LD72B7JFUA,1484283895000,10,True,CamelBak,Plastic,"Reusable, kids, straw top",Iguanas,"Carrying Loop, Straw",400.0,1

It holds about one water bottle and then some. When I got it in the mail it had the dent on the bottom; but because it didn’t mess with the stablility of it, it didn’t bother me. Only draw back I can think of is when opening it it’s kinda loud. Especially during a lecture.

4.0,"Cute, durable and leak proof.  Not perfect, but as close as you're going to get for stainless steel.","This is a very cute water bottle.  It's a stainless steel container with a screw top lid.  When it's screwed on tightly, it's definitely leak proof.  I did the full of water shake proof test.  It's definitely leak proof.  The colors on the bottle are vibrant and after some use and washing and dropping and general abuse by a 2 year old toddler, it's held up pretty well.  It has some scratches and a small dent, but it doesn't chip or crack like plastic.<br /><br />The container is well insulated and keeps her drink cold fairly well, but don't mistake this for a thermos style bottle.  That it is not.  If you take this out with you, the water will definitely turn warm.  I can tell the water flow is good because I can hear it as she's drinking from it.  She doesn't gag or choke on her water like she does with some other bottles (where the flow is too fast) and she doesn't complain that it's hard to get the water out (where the leak proof valve makes it hard to suction the water).<br /><br />My only issue with this water bottle is with the lid.  The mouthpiece is similar to a sports top water bottle.  The neck of the bottle tapers in a lot from the body of the bottle meaning my kid has to tip the bottle to where it's almost upside down to drink from it once she's halfway through with the bottle.  That's okay.  But the lid is attached so she has to turn the bottle sideways so the lid isn't squishing her nose.  Also when the mouthpiece is turned to open the flow to drink, you can't close the lid.  At this point, I'm probably splitting hairs, but it's a pain to constantly twist the mouthpiece to open and close it.  It means I'm constantly touching the mouthpiece (or my kid is touching it which is worse!) which is high on the yuck factor.  Last point - remember that it has a sport top - washing it is dubious at best.  So stick to just water in this bottle.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great bottle.  It's small enough where it's not too heavy for a 2 year old (considering it's stainless steel) even when it's fully filled with water.  It's easy to drink from and is leak proof.  She's even managed to drop it on the lid hinge and it has yet to crack, fall off or break.  Hoping it's as tough as it has proven thus far.  4 stars.",[],B00GK9JLQ4,B00GK9JLQ4,AEOEUEZINH6432YDLXJENERMAR3A,1409245282000,1,True,SIGG,Aluminum,,Red,,300.0,1
4.0,Not Leak Proof,Bought this for my son to take to school (3yo) and the design is cute but it’s not leak proof like my old CamelBak from way back when.

Because he’s 3 he’s not really trying to close it so it’s ok for what we need to use it for which is why is still gets 4 stars. I’m hoping this was just a faulty lid and no one else has this issue.

4.0,Quality bottle in almost every way,"I have 2 of these (both Chute .75L mag lid) and have used them for over a year each.  Not every day, but on average once every 3 days, I'd say.  For just water, it is perfect.  For anything with a color to it, it's got a minor flaw that irks me a bit and is annoying.<br /><br />The construction is sound: I've had nothing break, and I've dropped it a bit.  I didn't not intentionally roughhouse it or throw it or crush it, FWIW, but it's got no degradation of the construction.  I usually hand wash because the lid's grooves are tough to get into in the dishwasher, but I've put it through the dishwasher a bit too.<br /><br />The mag lid is pretty cool, but my issue with this product preventing 5 stars is that the lid retains some of the fluid, which can cause a drip which can get on your shirt or floor.  With water, it's no big deal, but if you have iced coffee or a protein shake or something that has color to it, there is a strong potential for dripping onto a shirt.  When you're enjoying a protein shake or iced coffee on your drive to work, and a drop of coffee gets on a white dress shirt, it's not a good situation to be in.  For that reason I ONLY recommend this if you're either:<br />A) Someone who only drinks water, OR<br />B) Someone who doesn't care if whatever they're drinking gets on their shirt or floor (just a drop or two).<br />As someone who has to meet with people for a living, and not look like a slob, I don't recommend this bottle for that reason alone.  Having a water bottle that almost always drips onto my shirt when I'm driving to work, or drips something onto the floor at home, is really annoying.<br /><br />There are two ways to prevent this:<br />1) Never allow fluid to get in the lid.  Impossible if you're shaking up a protein shake or something that requires volatile action to prepare.  And also tough to avoid if you move with the bottle in any sort of active way, which is really what the bottle should be designed for.<br />2) Remove the fluid when you open the cap.  This requires shoving a paper towel into the small recess, which is about the size of my pinky finger, so it's not straightforward and certainly not easy to do while driving.<br /><br />I haven't found a perfect alternative but this is still a quality bottle in every other way.",[],B07663KW9J,B097881CZ6,AEGAHZKIJLY4MRQVMX6RUTNEIFQA,1602009245668,3,True,CamelBak,Plastic,,Charcoal,"Carrying Loop, Magnetic Lid, Leak-proof when closed",750.0,1

5.0,I really like this bottle,"I really like this bottle. It keeps coffee hot, and keeps water cold. It's really, really well-made, and looks great. I like the loop at the neck--I can carry it with one finger. The bottle has a much bigger capacity than most bottles like this which is fantastic. It's also very, very tall. I think they chose to make it taller rather than wide so it would be more likely to fit in cupholders. But it will probably fall out of some bottle pockets on backpacks. It's tall. I think it's best for drinks without calories or residue, because if you forget to clean it immediately after using it at some point, it is going to be really hard to get clean (and you can't put it in the washer). Since it's super tall it may not fit under your faucet, and you'll have to use a very long brush.<br /><br />Anyway I really like it. I use it at work, and it fits under the faucet there, and I don't need to carry it around in a backpack pocket.

5.0,Perfect size for 6-10 year olds....,"After purchasing (and eventually tossing) many water bottles, sippy cups, straw bottles etc.  I have found that these are the perfect water bottles for kids ages 6-10.

The older style was more difficult for little hands and so the cap would just hit them in the nose when they tried to drink - was not a deal breaker but this new lid is much better.  Although they are leak proof, both the mouth piece and the cap are easy to remove so kids can open both and drink or refill unassisted ... a big plus!

We sent two of these out to two different day care centers with our kids and both day cares sent them back saying they leaked. The thing is, in order for this to work correctly, the mouthpiece has to be installed correctly and snugly, otherwise it'll leak pretty badly. Teachers from both day cares either could not figure out how to use it or did not have the time to figure it out. So that's a small problem.

5.0,Perfect size finally! 22oz,"I started out w the 18oz in light pink which was great bc it fit nicely in my hand to drink & I could slide it in & out of my bag easily. The only issue was that I drink a lot of water so I was having to refill it a lot. When I lost it, I wanted to go up one size for less refills. I accidentally went up 2 sixes thought and bought the 32oz. The only thing I liked was that I had to refill way less (even when I waited overnight, the water was still always ice cold). However, that size was too fat for my hand to wrap around it comfortably & it was also really hard to fit in a bag. FINALLY after losing that one, I got the 22oz and it’s PERFECT! (I feel like Goldilocks writing this lol) but for real, it has the same circumference as the 18oz, but it’s taller so it can fit more water (less refills!) As w the other 2, the leak-proofing could use some work, but as long as you don’t keep it laying on its side or upside down, you’ll be fine lol. Also, the Nebula design is GORGEOUS!! Overall, super happy with this water bottle!

I had purchased a couple of straw spout ones from walmart, but ended up not liking them nearly as much as I thought I would.<br />I came upon these while browsing Amazon and saw it had the open chute spout and thought &#34;why not?&#34;.<br />I'm really glad I ordered it, I notice I'm drinking a lot more water now (I tend to drink less when using a straw), it's not awkward at all to carry around with me, and when I drink from it I don't feel like there's a waterfall rushing into my mouth!  Lol<br />I've already ordered a second one and my six year old son is now asking for one like mine as well because he likes it better than his Ninja Turtle water bottle. 😁<br />Overall, I'm extreamly satisfied with this purchase.",[],B015DJC71C,B015DJC71C,AHXIBAA2FGVH26GWTUJGJBDCQBIA,1486015931000,0,True,CamelBak,100% Nylon,,Sea Glass,Leak Proof,750.0,1

5.0,Extremely Clever Design,"I normally am not one to rave about something as mundane as a water bottle, but the CamelBak Chute Mag water bottle is just such a cleverly thoughtful design that it deserves some words of praise.  I was looking for a water bottle that wasn't too large (around 500 ml), slim design to easily fit into a backpack or carrying bag bottle pouch, a substantial carrying handle (i.e. not just a flimsy strap that attaches the lid to the bottle) and did not have a ""dribble"" drinking opening.  (The 500 ml Nalgene water bottle that I was replacing was notoriously prone to ""dribble"" problems, at least with my mouth.)  An elegant design solution to the dribble problem with the CamelBak is simply to design the spout and cap such that the screw threads on the spout are on the inside diameter (rather than external threads like the Nalgene), so that one's lips easily seal around the smooth outside opening.  Since the entire top piece of the bottle unscrews for easy filling and cleaning, the drinking spout opening is relatively small for more comfortable drinking.  The ""Mag"" design had just been released when I went to order the previous model of the CamelBak which utilized some kind of strap arrangement on the top to hold the spout cap out of the way when drinking, but for almost the same price, I opted for the new ""Mag"" design, thinking it was likely just a gimmick.  To my surprise, it is an elegant solution to the minor, but annoying problem of the cap being in the way.  The threaded spout cap is attached to the top piece via a flexible plastic ""hinge"", such that when the cap is unscrewed and flipped back it is held fully open by internal magnets in the cap and top piece, completely out of the way while drinking, but easily flipped back afterward.  Finally, the carry handle molded onto the top piece is substantial and large enough to fit several fingers through the rectangular opening.  I often use a full-size carabiner to clip the handle to a belt loop, backpack or camera case strap with no concern about the handle breaking off.  I purchased the 600 ml capacity bottle which is perfect for my purposes, but the Chute Mag also is available in smaller and larger sizes (up to 1000 ml).  Highly recommended, and very reasonably priced on Amazon.",[],B07663V9FZ,B07R1C6RGG,AHZ6DKVHYV2MU5SXM74PRGMVCQEA,1543371359117,4,True,CamelBak,Plastic,,Iris,"Lightweight, Leak Proof",384.4555,1

My kid doesn't mind and neither do I. I LOVE the lid to this cup. The straw part comes off and is short enough I can run a pipe cleaner through it to clean it. The straw part at the top is also open so it's VERY easy to clean. I did have to take a few minutes to teach my 3 year old how to flip the straw up. He was amused by the straw and loves to flip it now. He loves this cup, there is a pocket on his little backpack that fits this perfectly so it's always kept upright. I'm not sure this would be a great cup for a kid younger than 2.5 as it does leak a tad if left on it's side. My son is similar to me in that he doesn't like to drink from plastic. At home we use a lot of glass but at the park glass can easily be broken.

I almost always have a water bottle with me, and this is perfect for me - I put in some ice and water and that water stays cold all day, even if the bottle stays in a hot car while I am in a store.  After a day trip with my husband on a hot day, he had some of my water and couldn't believe my water was not only still nice and cold, but there were still a few small ice cubes in there, so I just ordered one for him too!

Contigo water bottles seal properly and do not leak.  This water bottle has a straw which is great for toddlers.  I would not hesitate to purchase this water bottle for your kids.

4.0,"Our favorite bottle, even though they leak when the straw shakes loose inside","[[VIDEOID:7c0192c4c6a3bf884961d7c79142c782]] We have purchased several of these Contigo Autospout water bottles over the past few years. While there are design issues with the interior of them, we will likely continue to purchase them in the coming years because they are our favorites. Here's what we've discovered about them:<br /><br />PROS<br />The kids (1.5 and 3 years old) can open them really easily and close them. Other water bottles pose problems for them, but these work every time and eliminate the tears that we get with other bottles.<br /><br />They keep water chilled, even on hot summer days. We don't use ice, but it's nice to have water moderately cool when it's hot outside. We only put water in them because they are hard to clean and we do not want to have any unseen bacteria under the lid.<br /><br />The handle/loop on the top makes it easy for the kids to walk around with the bottles. It's also easy for me to attach the bottles to my stroller with a clip.<br /><br />These bottles don't leak--as long as the straw is installed correctly on the inside and the spout is in the closed position on the top.<br /><br />The bottles also come with excellent cleaning and care instructions--which you WILL want to read, as there are many parts on the inside that can get mold growth if they are not cleaned properly.<br /><br />The stainless steel bottle does not get scratched or dirty the way the plastic bottles do. With our Contigo plastic bottles, they get scratched and start to look 20 years old the moment we put them in the bottom of the stroller or drop them.<br /><br />CONS<br />The base of this water bottle is wide, so it does not fit into the cup holders on our BOB or Graco Strollers. The kids need to put them in the seat next to them. Sometimes this frustrates them, as they like to have cups in their cupholders (they're very organized, I guess).<br /><br />The bottle leaks rather easily if you don't install the inner-workings properly. Read the instructions when they come--or watch the video I uploaded. I basically went for 2 years having not read the instructions, so these bottles would leak ALL THE TIME and I couldn't figure out why. The inner working are kind of complicated at first. When I finally got a new bottle and read the instructions, we have had far fewer issues. Basically, there's an order to putting the straw into place on the inside of the water bottle...and you MUST follow that order or the straw shakes loose very easily. When the straw is loose, the water will leak out if the spout is left open.<br /><br />Again, this is our favorite water bottle--even with the issues I listed. We have several of them already and will continue to add to our collection as needed.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610-VQUHG6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610-VQUHG6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610-VQUHG6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mNJa22MhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mNJa22MhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mNJa22MhL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7127n7A4CVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7127n7A4CVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7127n7A4CVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718KY7RDamL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718KY7RDamL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718KY7RDamL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FPOXxf2GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FPOXxf2GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FPOXxf2GL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a2eyBhHRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a2eyBhHRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a2eyBhHRL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s5qeDTL4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s5qeDTL4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s5qeDTL4L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00TLNXIOC,B00TLNXIOC,AENEVJH3U3MYSPDNE6VBEQCW2V4Q,1466770050000,104,True,Contigo,Stainless Steel,,Sapphire,"Dishwasher Safe, Cold 24 hour, Spillproof",295.735,1

I like the mouth piece on this bottle opposed to the ones with the weird straw, where you have to suck the liquid out like a baby, and that's awkward and unbecoming. This has held up well so far after a few weeks of constant daily use, it has no weird rubber or plastic smells like some bottles I've used in the past, the handle is nice when I have my hands full of keys, purse, papers, etc., and the lid is secure, no leaking at all. It only fits in my pull-out dash cup holder in my van (Town & Country for reference), though, and it's even a tight fit there, but it stays in place while driving, so good enough.

The powder coating and the stainless steel stood up to the abuse that only a clumsy college student could put it through: falling down stairs, skidding across the parking lot, etc. with only a couple minor scuffs and dents.<br /><br />One of the largest benefits to this bottle is the stainless steel liner on the lid. Don't want your beer to cool off too fast in a hot apartment? No problem.

The water stays where it's supposed to, though it includes an extra &#34;tip&#34; which is what makes it leakproof, so I'm guessing it either wears or comes off easily.  So far, no problems.<br /><br />I'd probably recommend a double-wall-type bottle if you care about maintaining temperature.  But I already have one of those, and it wasn't what I was looking for.

I have no issue with this, but it is something to take note of. The water bottle itself is amazing, and worth every penny. I tend to only have to put more ice in it one time a day, no matter how much I refill it. (The water I refill it with is obvious already cold) Even without ice, the water stay at a perfectly cold temperature, which is perfect for long days out etc. The bottle comes with an extra straw along with a coupon for a free boot or lid (you pay shipping).

5.0,The best infuser bottle available,"I love this infuser bottle.  It is made with quality the other infuser bottles just don't have.  I have tried many, returned many--kept few.  This one is a keeper.  I drink almost entirely fruit/veggie infused water and always have some with me.  The problems (in my opinion) for the competition are many.  Here are the highlights of this bottle.<br />1) You absolutely want a bottom of the bottle basket in an infuser.  With a top basket design as most of the other bottles are-when you drink the water level past the level the fruit basket goes to-your left with soggy yucky fruit hanging over a half full bottle of water not infusing anything.  Everyone says they will leak--they don't as long as you have quality construction with a silicone ring and most importantly don't overfill the fruit basket.  If you try to squish your fruit in and think if you just screw it together a little tighter it will be ok-you will have leaks.  You really don't need more than what will comfortably fit in the basket to flavor your water anyway.<br />2) I love the straw and the fact that it is removable to make cleaning easier.  With other bottles without a straw your left tilting the bottle up to your mouth giving it an adult sippy cup feel which I can't stand.  Also the straw goes right to the bottom of the cup meaning when you sip water through the straw your getting the water that is in the bottom close to the marinating fruit.  This to me intensifies the flavor.<br />3) The strainer is the perfect size to keep even the tiniest lemon seeds from getting through.  You do get some fruit particles into the water but nothing even big enough to notice, I'm talking bits small enough they are undetectable to your tongue.  I've used the Infuser Pro bottle and the core round strainer that fits in the center of the bottle is impractical and poorly designed.  Its holes are too big allowing fruit bits and even small seeds into the water and its very hard to cut fruit to fit into the cylinder shaped basket.  Another cup I tried out and quickly returned had very fine mesh to contain the fruit but it was a nightmare to clean.  This bottom cup design is easy to get fruit in and out and doesn't require you to make a fruit salad worth of cuts just to get things to fit in.  Its strainer is small enough to be effective but not so small its impossible to get clean.<br />4)  I love the autospout.  To others saying they have problems with water spouting out of the top-thats easily avoidable.  First, when you fill your bottle with water-have the spout open so air can escape from the straw and spout which decreases pressure in the bottle.  Once you have the lid screwed on close the spout.  Second, the first time you open the bottle for the day when it is all the way full (or if you have left the bottle in the car or someplace hot) push the button to pop open the spout but hold your finger over the spout and allow it to come up slowly preventing any pressure from releasing with a splash to go along with it.  I make this sound like a problem but it isn't for me, just takes a little common sense to realize that its a bottle and will become pressurized with heat or overfilling.  I only have a problem with water spurting out if I leave this in the car in the heat which in that scenario, just about every water bottle with a straw design will have the same issue-this isn't a design flaw with the bottle.  The spout is soft enough to be comfortable on your lips but firm enough to stand up to cleaning and use.  I love that when it is closed it is covered completely so I don't have to worry about drinking from something thats been rolling around in my purse or bag uncovered.  The button lock is a great feature.  I can put this in my backpack and not worry that it will pop open from something in the bag bumping into it.  Other bottles use a large plastic cover for the top of the bottle that needs to be pushed all the way open so that it doesn't bump into your nose while you drink from it, this is a terrible design in my opinion.  The contigo autospout solves this problem by using a fold down design-much better for the looks and function of the bottle.<br />5)  The carabiner type clip on the top of the bottle really does come in handy.  It functions as a handle for carrying the bottle and also allows me to clip this to my bag handle and keep this in the outside pocket of my backpack without worrying it will pop out and get lost.  I take this on hikes and the clip means this can hang from the backpack and not use up precious space inside the bag.  Its also easily accessible to get a hold of it quickly without having to open my pack.<br />6)  Size is important.  In this case, the size is perfect.  Big enough that your not constantly refilling the bottle but not so big that it doesn't fit in a standard car cupholder.  Its slightly larger around than a soda can and is quite tall but this for me isn't an issue.  I prefer tall and thin over short and fat when it comes to ease of use.  I can't fit this under my in fridge door ice maker due to the height but thats an easy fix.  Either use a cup to get your ice and then pour it in or--even smarter--put the ice in the bottle with only the strainer on the bottom but with the fruit basket not yet attached.  The strainer is more than sturdy enough to keep the ice in.  Then screw on the fruit cup to the bottom and fill with water and insert the straw top into your icy water.  Without the fruit cup attached this will easily fit in the in fridge door ice dispenser.<br />7)  Ease of cleaning is important.  Who wants to be messing around with tiny flimsy plastic parts every time you need to clean your bottle.  This bottle has sturdy parts and few of them.  The straw is detachable, the spout washes out very easily.  The bottle and the fruit cup are made of thick sturdy plastic that is a breeze to clean with a bottle brush or even a kitchen sponge  and the filter that snaps between the bottle and fruit cup is thick plastic and snaps off for cleaning as well.  The silicone ring doesn't need to be removed every time you clean your bottle, I give it a wipe with a soapy sponge and around every other week or so I roll it down a little to clean underneath and on all sides.<br />Its safe to say I have had at least 10 previous infuser bottles--most of which have been returned.  This is my favorite.  I have several as I'm afraid they will stop making it and I won't be able to get another one.  I've given a few as gifts and have one in the closet waiting just in case I lose mine or break it (which the original is still going strong with 6+ months of use).  My local Target carries these but they were $14.99 when I last checked so the price was better on Amazon and at this time it still is.  This bottle has one flaw--and its a minor one.  I like cold water--usually with ice in it.  As this is not a double walled bottle-condensation is an issue.  Other bottles like the Infusion Pro come with a neoprene sleeve to use with the bottles to cover them and block condensation.  They still produce condensation but with the cover on it doesn't make your hands wet when you grab on.  I would prefer a double walled bottle like a Tervis water bottle has but so far no one has made one with an infuser.  If this cup were double walled-it would be perfect.",[],B01BD0R5BM,B073WBGZPR,AF6GOXYKLWS3NBI6BOO3L2YH5RGQ,1471143318000,0,False,Contigo,Plastic,,Scuba,,709.764,1

The option to drink straight from the bottle, which I do not like to do but liked having the option.  The locking lid with a push button to open and the lifting lock that can be used as a carry strap.  This is the first water bottle for which I have paid $15 which in my opinion is expensive, but after using it I felt it was money well spent.  The only issue I have is that I dropped it one time, which is inevitable, and the lid broke and now will not open.  It is no longer $15 well spent because the warranty of course does not cover dropping it and I have to toss it.  I was disappointed that for $15 the bottle was not sturdy enough to handle being dropped one time.

I put water and four or five ice cubes in it to take it with me while running errands, and the water stayed nicely chilly even after being left in the car in direct sun for an hour or so. I plan to keep this flask with my field sketching supplies. The idea was to find a flask large enough to quench my thirst on a short outing of a few hours but also small enough for my sketching bag.

5.0,Greatest bottle ever made by humans,"So, I the last person in the world to cave to new and trending things.  So when I started seeing these seemingly trendy ""overpriced"" bottles a few years ago, I thought, ""Great, they figured out a way to sell 'Green Canteens' for $40.  Yay capitalism!""  However, after having so many friends tell me about their ""amazing swell bottles"", I finally caved and bought one.  Here's what happened to make me write this review:<br /><br />I took the bottle to work filled with ice water at 9am, but as i am not used to carrying around a water bottle, i put it on my desk, left work on friday completely forgetting about the bottle.  I return to work on monday and see the bottle on my desk at 9am (~72hrs later) and pick it up.  Its slightly cool to the touch, but no condensation, no water ring on the desk.  I open it up and THERE IS STILL ICE INSIDE!!!  That's right, 72 hours and there is still unmelted ice inside this thing.  I have a few Camelback insulated bottles for biking/hiking that will keep ice unmelted for maybe 6-8 hours, but i have never had a bottle like this before.  This thing is nearly space age in its efficiency to keep things insulated.  Seriously, i think maybe this bottle is made from wormhole technology that violates the First law of thermodynamics. Part of me wants to run an experiment of how long it takes for ice to actually completely melt and reach room temperature in this thing.<br /><br />So, its true the bottle is expensive, but considering that you are buying forbidden alien technology, possibly from the future, for $40; that seems like a bargain!",[],B01D7VRMPY,B0BSQKS5ZF,AGD2A4KSFR7DTEBT7UIRTFDLNVOA,1541008882497,2,True,S'well,Stainless Steel,,Blue Marble,Free,502.7495,1

5.0,BEST PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE IN THE WORLD,"(Charcoal gray 40oz no-straw)<br /><br />PROS:<br />Quiet when it falls<br />Doesn't dent other metal stuff<br />Sturdy<br />Dishwasher safe, can take apart to clean<br />Leak proof<br />Easy to chug out of<br />Button controls water flow<br />Locking mechanism<br />Protective spout cap<br />Great color<br />Large capacity, less refills<br />Fits in car cup holder<br />Easy-carry sturdy handle w/ range of motion<br />Decent price<br />Gives me happiness<br /><br />CONS:<br />Not insulative<br />No lines on sides except top 40oz line<br />May not fit in some cup holders<br />You'll wish you'd had it earlier<br /><br />-------<br />I needed a plastic water bottle that wouldn't dent the other metallic things that I often carry with me, and wouldn't be as loud when it falls over in class. I hate most chug lids that don't allow air to escape elsewhere, and I hate straws with a passion (I do not have the energy to try to suck water out when I'm working out and breathing hard), so I was looking for a design with an auto spout like I used to have on the water bottle I lost a few years ago. I also like large capacity water bottles because I can drink the amount of water I need in a day without having to refill it every five seconds. I'm a hydration freak so I go through water fast. Even with the capacity though, this does still fit on my car holder. Some cars it won't fit in, sadly, but for mine it does. I also needed an easy way to hold it with one finger so I can carry ten things like I'm always doing and not use an entire hand to grip a water bottle.<br /><br />This has all of that and more. It's easy to clean, dishwasher safe (I don't have a dishwasher so I just take it apart and clean in with a bottle brush), AND has the locking mechanism I always wonder why other brands didn't have. So when I'm packing it in a backpack and it tips upside down, I don't have to worry about something pressing the button and making it leak all over everything. Also love the neutral colors it comes in and it's still a decently reasonable price. The handle doesn't fall apart like my other one because it's not made of crumbly rubber, and instead is made of hard plastic and metal screws. The handle goes all the way back and pretty far forward too. The spout has a protective lid so you don't get dirt on it, and you can chug or ""waterfall"" as much water as you need without straining to suck water out or getting your face practically vacuum sealed to the spout for lack of air escapes.<br /><br />If you ever need a plastic water bottle, get THIS ONE. It is beyond perfect. It has never leaked or broken, and I'm a pretty clumsy lady.<br /><br />It does not have markings on the sides except for the 40oz line, and is obviously not insulative, but for me it works wonderfully.

4.0,"Easy to clean, not quite as easy to drink from","For the most part, I really like this water bottle. I just bought it for my 3 year old as we're wanting to retire his playtex sip & grip straw cup. One thing I love about it - there's not many parts to clean, so I don't have to worry about mold getting into places that I can't see very well. It also comes apart and assembles very easily.<br /><br />It definitely is spill proof - we've had it for about 2 weeks and haven't had one spill yet.<br /><br />The only con, which is stated in several other reviews, is that it is kind of hard to drink from. You have to REALLY suck on it to get water to come out. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be a huge issue for my child and he seems to manage with only a small amount of frustration once in awhile.<br />If the valve is taken out, getting liquids out shouldn't be a problem at all for a child, the only downside to that would be that it wouldn't be spill-proof then.<br /><br />For us, it seems to work and I just ordered another one of these for my almost 2 year old.<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD:<br />Because I liked this so much with my 3 year old, I decided to purchase on for my 22 month old and see if it would work. I was nervous that he wouldn't be able to get any liquid out because it's kind of hard to suck on, but he doesn't seem to have a problem and now both of my boys are happy to enjoy their ""big boy water bottles"".

The top half works well, and separates easily from the bottom for storage, washing, or just to take off and add water to the bottle.  The auto seal is stable, you press the red button at the top side of the lid for the mouthpiece to open.

Very good isolation.<br /><br />In conclusion, the only thing I'll end up upgrading will be the carabiner that comes with it.

5.0,Great bottle.,"I love this bottle. So much cleaner than refilling my 16-20 oz bottle for water when I'm in meetings all day. And so easy to clean it too. A very durable bottle all the way. I pop that lid I don't know how many times every day and it is still tight as a drum. The lid and opening button are still tight too. I'm darn glad I reviewed this before I bought it. I do this with everything I buy online. Thanks for making a good product. I'm very satisfied so far. Addition to my review. I bought this bottle back in 2018 while I was in rehab at a VA program. We had to have a bottle that the staff could see if you were drinking water or what not. This is 2021 now and I’m still using the same bottle I bought in 2018. I’m kinda rough with it sometimes and it falls or drops from the table or counter or wherever,and it hasn’t cracked or anything like that. I put ice in it,fill it up with juice or some water for the road trip or hiking. As to how long it keeps things cold? I haven’t counted the number of hours but it still has ice in it at least for several hours of use. I bought a insulated bottle carrier for it and it stays cold for hours. I honestly use it every day of the week and it still has a tight lid and latch. I’ve put it in my dishwasher too and it still looks good enough for all the places I go. Meetings,work,just relaxing at the house or wherever. I’m a really big fan of this bottle and I’m thinking about getting another one just because. Totally leakproof as well.

5.0,Pretty much perfect water bottle,"My poor old leaky water bottle finally drove me to Amazon to find its replacement. It would leak for a month, then it would be fine for awhile, then it would leak again. It was ridiculous. So I did my usual long, in-depth research, and I decided on this water bottle. Between the reviews, the awesome return policy the company has, and the cool look of the bottle, I was pretty sure I had found my next best friend. I was right.<br /><br />I had over estimated the size of my old bottle so I thought I was getting one the same size but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was wrong. This one is bigger, but it ended up being a perfect size for me. Everything about this bottle took a little getting used to. I had been using one that had a pop up straw and no lid. I've had this Embrava water bottle now for a few months and everything still works like it should. The loopy handle that it has around the neck is nice. It makes it really easy to carry around. The only thing I don't get is how to take the strap off or if it even comes off. It just means I have to take care to keep it away from the water when I'm filling it up. First world problems, though, right?<br /><br />At first I found it hard to drink out of, especially if I was wearing makeup. You kinda have to get your face all up in there since the spout you drink out of is so short. That was annoying at first, but I don't even notice it anymore. Until now, I had forgotten that I even had trouble with it at first. I guess my face figured out how to work in cooperation with the spout.<br /><br />There honestly isn't a single aspect of this bottle that I dislike.

4.0,It's an Uninsulated Plastic Water Bottle - But a Durable One,"Except for the hinge pin and the two rubber gaskets, this appears to be entirely made out of plastic. It is an almost transparent blue bottle with a dark gray lid. It has a 40-ounce capacity. The bottle ""necks down"" a bit towards the top, which makes it easier to hold on to (which is good, because there is no real handle). There is a (more or less) rectangular ""loop"" attached to the hinge, which one can attach a carabiner to and hang it from a belt loop if they so desire. There is no carabiner included, however. I suppose you could stick your finger through this lip and carry it around that way... but I wouldn't. And, again, it's not really a handle, as such; you certainly won't be using it to hold the bottle while you're drinking.<br /><br />The lid screws off, and is gasketed. AND... there's a button that, when pressed, causes the top of the lid to pop open (on a hinge, of sorts). When opened, a short drinking spout is revealed! This means that it'll stay clean, because you'll have the top closed when not actively drinking from it. There is also a simple integrated slide-lock, which protects against accidental button presses. And there is even a rubber gasket in the top that contacts the drinking spout when the top is shut. In other words, this bottle does not leak, and I do not expect it to do so in the future.<br /><br />With the lid unscrewed/removed, one can easily insert standard ice cube tray ice into the bottle; no need to break them into smaller pieces or use special ice cube trays to make your ice cubes. However... Due to the fact that the bottle does reduce in size - which, again, makes it easier to hold with one's hand - you aren't getting your hand in there unless you're only a month old. Therefore, in order to clean the inside of the bottle, you'll need to use a long-handled brush, sponge-on-a-stick, the world's smallest drone with a cleaning attachment, a highly trained garter snake, your mutant telekinesis, et cetera. This is the reason why I am giving this item four stars instead of five. I decided to not ding its score for not having a (real, useful) handle, because one would add bulk, and that might not have been appreciated, plus it would be plastic and, therefore, something that might break.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to recommend this item to someone who has sense enough to use filtered water from their kitchen sink instead of purchasing water ""by the bottle"" - with the caveat that this is an *uninsulated* bottle. If you like cold water, refrigerate it first, and add some ice cubes. If you want to drink cold juice (et cetera) from it, you should be able to make juice ice cubes. . . .",[],B09RNCKQ1L,B0C8K5NRS1,AH442GVLFNPSDQNDAVZCYGDYFOWQ,1654161844336,0,False,Contigo,Tritan Plastic,Standard Bottle,Juniper & Pink Lemonade,"Dishwasher Safe,Leakproof",709.764,1

The design of the bottle facilitates an easy grasp more secure grasp of it. My only complaint was when I saw some mold growth on the interior of the bottle which took several washes to clean out (the last wash using some chlorine bleach).

5.0,Great water bottle for inside the office,"I got this bottle because I've been making an effort to use fewer plastic bottles over the course of my day at work. We have a lot of bottled drinks at work, but we also have nice water machines. I figure that this bottle was a good opportunity for me to drink more water and help the environment by lowering the number of plastic bottles I recycle over the course of a day.<br /><br />If you're looking for a bottle to use inside the office, I think this is a great choice. It's big, so you don't have to refill it often. The smaller mouth (still bigger than your average coke bottle) makes it less likely for you to have a water disaster and spill water all over yourself or your computer.<br /><br />Nothing against water bottles with bite straws or the original Nalgenes, but I like this bottle because it doesn't seem like you're just using your gym bottle at your desk. It seems like you're drinking water out of your desk bottle. It doesn't &#34;glug&#34; with normal drinking and the cap screws back on quickly and securely.<br /><br />With its higher capacity, you'll be happy that you won't have to keep refilling your bottle over the course of the day. If you're using your bottle outdoors, it should last you for the better part of a long hike or run at the track (and maybe even have some left for the car ride home!). The smoke color is pretty stylish and I like the measuring labels on the side as well to help keep track of how much water I drank that day.<br /><br />The build quality is great.

If you leave it open after you drink out of it (so the straw has time to empty) it seems to be better, but if you take a drink & close it right away, you’re wearing all the water in the straw next time you open it.

However, they DO hold a tiny bit more than 16 oz without filling it all the way to the top.<br /><br />I love these because there’s just the lid and the bottle. Lid is attached obviously (can’t lose it—win, win). No straws or mouth pieces to clean!! Excellent. And they fit perfectly in your hand or your child’s hand.<br /><br />I ordered the green (melon), blue (cerulean), and pink (magenta). The green and blue are perfect! Just as pictured. Here’s the reason for removing a star…my daughter’s favorite color is purple. And so I would have ordered the amethyst but I don’t care for an orange lid with a purple bottle. The combination isn’t appealing. Instead, I ordered the magenta because I liked the color combination online.<br /><br />Teal lid with a fun pink, teal lettering, and what appears to be a purple lid strap to attach the lid. Well….the bottle is pink with a teal lid. However, the Nalgene logo is a royal blue, not teal. And the plastic lid strap that appeared to be purple is actually royal blue as well.

4.0,The best water bottles!,"I love these bottles. I have a few. They are really the best. To put aside beautiful designs and colors ( and they ARE so gorgeous! ), these bottles really keep my water cold all day long! ( I only use mine for water. ) If there's anything left in there the next day, it is still as cold as it was the day before! Sometimes I leave it at the back seat of my car, or in a cup holder, out in the sun all day. It happens. But guess what? Even though it's warm to touch after a day in the sun, the water inside is actually still ice cold! Ah-mazing! Plus, no all different kind of toxins leeching into my water like with plastic bottles.<br /><br />These bottles don't leak! You can toss them into your bag, backpack, purse, back sit of your car... wherever... they won't leak!<br /><br />They are also really condensation-free and always dry to touch!<br /><br />They do scratch ( the paint on them ), but not as easily as some would think. Most of mine are still as good as new even after having them for quite some time. And the bottle itself is actually very durable. Some of mine went trough he77 and back, and never even cracked, little less break or something else. I have a dent on one that was dropped from a pretty high place. That's about it. But they do scratch. I guess it's a small price to pay for their durability and functionality. But I'd like to see S'well make some bottles without these paints or whatever it all is, though. Just stainless steel. Or a coating of something that is gonna be more resilient to scratches.<br /><br />I see a lot of ""this is a fake product"" reviews"". Be sure to order only the ones that are shipped and sold by Amazon! Only those are originals! Buying from anyone else is a lottery.<br /><br />Also, just a heads up: S'well is making some changes to be more environmentally friendly, and they are getting rid of the original boxes. The bottle will now come only with a slim belly band instead of the cardboard tubes. I can understand that. But that is pretty scary when those bottles ship from Amazon because they just toss them in a plastic shipping bags, without any protection whatsoever! So of course they arrive all banged and danged up. I hope they will change this asap and start packing them more securely. If not, there will be a lot of returns. It will sure make me think twice before ordering them from Amazon again.<br /><br />They also changed their clear/white orings in caps to black orings.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hYxo8N12L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hYxo8N12L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hYxo8N12L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x7B7V+VtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x7B7V+VtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x7B7V+VtL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B06WW82V6X,B0160ELQL6,AFDOMMVVHPYQD5OGD4C2U35YBPJA,1564780873859,3,True,S'well,Stainless Steel,,Calacatta Gold,,260.0,1

The plastic has an almost velvety feel to it.  I have had quite a few people compliment it based on appearance alone.  My one criticism would be the tiny hole above the mouth portion that can drip water if the bottle is fully filled, but this really doesn't bother me (just wanted to give a balanced review).  I don't like drinking cold water, so I can't comment on how well it maintains temperature.  Water tastes very delicious, no plastic taste at all.

And with the college offering water refill stations throughout the campus, these Nalgene bottles just made sense.

I wish Nalgene would make a water bottle similar to the CamelBak Chute Bottle, .75 L.  I am not a fan of the water bottles with built-in straws because they can't ever be throughly cleaned.

5.0,BEST WATER BOTTLE EVER!! &lt;3,"I bought two of the 40 oz water bottles along with the sip caps (love those too!) for my trip to Disney last week. I would fill them up at the resort everyday with ice and then water and take it with me into the parks. We were there for 8 days straight in low to mid 90's for 14 hours a day (outside)... I would just fill the bottle with more water at the water fountains and EVERY day when we got &#34;home&#34;, I would still have ice in them!  Once, I forgot to dump the ice at night so I left it go and it still lasted through the 2nd day!  These bottles blew my mind and never once leaked in our backbacks or sweat at all.  I would highly recommend to anyone for ANY purpose if you want a nice, cold, refreshing drink handy all day and night.  I didn't try hot liquids in it, but I can't imagine it wouldn't stay hot!",[],B019HFLGM4,B0BGM8TW2T,AED7JV7IBYD4RBWY5NF6KEMHLFXA,1508409704507,0,True,Healthy Human,steel,,Bahama,,470.0,1

5.0,Customer for life,"I absolutely LOVE this water bottle. I used to drink out of glass bottles because let's face it, water tastes so much better coming out of a glass vessel. But I found that I wasn't drinking enough because I detest warm water and my Lifefactory just wasn't cutting it during my 12 hour shifts (I can't constantly refill it with ice). And so began my search for another eco-friendly, non-toxic, durable and attractive water bottle. I was apprehensive at first about purchasing a $28 container to hold liquid but I am SO glad I did. Not only do I drink more water, I actually look forward to filling my stein because I know the contents will be cold whenever I do get a chance to stop running around and take a sip.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Doesn't sweat. An added bonus during study time with papers everywhere.<br />* The handle. It's comfortable and can be easily grabbed with two, three or four fingers.<br />* My water stays cold for hours! Haven't truly tested for how long but the longest I've gone without drinking after filling was 10 hours and it was still ice cold.<br />* No nasty aftertaste. The water tastes pure, like I was drinking from glass. That was part of the reason I took so long to purchase it. I have not tried other beverages in this container (like wine, juice or coffee) but I'm hoping that there will still be no residual taste.<br />* It sits in my Subaru cup holder comfortably. I bought the 21 oz and it's perfect to carry around without being too heavy or bulky.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Not enough colors to choose from! I've been obsessively checking for new stock as I plan to buy several more but would like wider variety. The stainless steel works great for now but I can't wait to buy the Key Lime color and May can't come soon enough.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R5Z2FmQNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R5Z2FmQNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R5Z2FmQNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00YIVHP0A,B0BGM8TW2T,AERQ7DSGZG5U77K7FJBJO6KVQXBQ,1459748463000,16,True,Healthy Human,steel,,Bahama,,470.0,1

5.0,"Ice Cold Water, Improved Design, Larger Size","I love my Contigo auto seal chill bottles and have owned several. I carry mine everywhere I go, day and night. I love having ice cold water all of the time. My first purchase was in 2014 and these bottles have been my costant companion ever since.<br /><br />I was happy when Contigo came out with this 24 oz version, so that I do not have to refill my water bottle as often. The ice does take up space so you aren't really getting the full # of ounces with each fill which isn't a problem but I am happy with the larger size for that reason. They have also improved the top handle making it with a harder plastic that is less likely to break and it no longer pops off like the old ones did.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this model comes in fewer colors. I really love the bright bottle colors the 20 oz. versions come in, both because they are fun and because they help our family keep track of who's is who's. This version only comes with different colored lids.<br /><br />All in all I cannot complain, however.

5.0,Awesome redesign of the classic bottle!,"I've been using Camelbak Eddy bottles for at least the past 10 years. They are the perfect bottles to bring with you to work, outside, or the gym. I mainly use my bottles at the gym where I can easily carry it around and get a quick drink of water whenever I need. What I love about the Eddy bottles is that they are durable and leak-proof. I never have to worry about my bottles cracking when dropped or leaking all over my backpack, and I've dropped many of them!<br /><br />The new redesign of the Eddy+ bottle bring some welcome changes. First of all, the loop on the bottle is bigger. Now instead of only being able to fit one finger though the loop you can now put 3 fingers through it. Now I feel like I'm less likely to drop the bottle when carrying it around the gym.<br /><br />The spout also got a small redesign. Instead of the spout being convex, it is now concave. I didn't know how I felt about the change at first, but it's proven to be very useful. I feel like you can get slightly more water out of the spout and there's a handy spot for your tongue to rest (if you like putting your tongue against your water bottle?)<br /><br />Lastly, the top of the bottle has been slightly redesigned. There's no longer a screw under the spout like on the old bottle. I often found that grime would get caught in this screw from time to time and you'd need to manually scrub it, but it is now gone.<br /><br />The Eddy bottle is a challenge to clean by hand. CamelBak sells scrubbing kits just to clean their bottles. I've found that if I put the bottles, straws, and lids in the dishwasher after use, the bottles come out sparkling clean. From experience I've found that only washing the bottles by hand without using a scrubbing brush allows grime to buildup in the bottle over time no matter how often you wash the bottle. You have to be EXTRA careful to clean inside the spout, under the lid, and where the straw connects to the lid. I've found that if you ignore these places, black mold spots are guaranteed to grow after a while.<br /><br />Overall I love these CamelBak bottles and the new redesign is definitely a step in the right direction for me! I'll definitely buy more of these when I inevitably lose my current bottle.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oRDS5knlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oRDS5knlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oRDS5knlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qu5bdN6AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qu5bdN6AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qu5bdN6AL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819Z6x7yz7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819Z6x7yz7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819Z6x7yz7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07HGQ4Q5S,B07HGR3S4C,AFJJD7ZLZK2RLAJ53BWYW6CQZWSQ,1559325426547,171,True,CamelBak,Eastman Tritan Copolyester,Reusable,Charcoal,"Carrying Loop, Straw, Leak Proof when closed",946.352,1

5.0,Great Bottle,"Nalgene durability makes this a great bottle, as well as the mouth, which is more than wide enough to provide a large flow of water (but not as wide as wide mouth bottles which make drinking difficult). I use two nalgene bottles on a frequent basis for going to the gym. I use this for water, and a wide mouth nalgene for protein shakes, as the wide mouth makes it easy to dump scoops of protein into it. Both have very large capacities, which is great for holding a large amount of liquid. This holds a bit more than a quarter of a gallon, which is a lot of fluid. The measuring lines are also great.<br /><br />I've used this, a wide mouth nalgene, a klean kanteen, and a nissan intak. The nissan intak is made of the same plastic, but it tends to shatter easier because of the less durable design (nalgene tritan's are cylindrical which is more sturdy and durable). Nissan intak had a better spout, but this is more than comfortable enough, its also more durable. The klean kanteen was great, but smells and tastes would permanently stick to the metal and no amount of cleaning would get them out. It also would get innumerable dings and dents in it that couldn't be fixed. My nalgene took the same beatings or worse and emerged with just a few cosmetic scratches.

5.0,Perfect for saving money on my Orange Juice fix!,"This bottle is perfect for what I needed it for. I cannot start my day without a glass of orange juice (I'm addicted to it more than coffee addicts need their cup in the morning). I was spending a fortune a week on individual-sized containers of OJ. I decided I wanted to get a refillable bottle to put my juice in, so I could buy larger containers of it for cheaper. I didn't want plastic for fear the acidic juice would start to deteriorate it over time, so glass was the obvious choice. This bottle was the perfect size, and the silicon sleeve helped me believe it wouldn't break on me if I knocked it over or dropped it. It works like a charm. I rinse it out with warm soapy water through the course of the week, then stick it in the dishwasher over the weekend to get it really clean. After reading some other reviews about how hard it was to get the sleeve back on, I had to laugh a little - the tag on the bottle actually says not to remove the sleeve - it is dishwasher safe and not meant to be taken off, EVER. Just make sure you keep it at least rinsed out between trips to the dishwasher - I forgot about it in my bag one weekend and once stuff inside starts to dry, it's very hard to wash out if you don't have a bottle brush.

5.0,Great light stainless steel option (not vacuum insulated),"Since I just went through and tossed out a lot of the old water bottles that my daughter had (quick rant: I'm starting to realize that the toddle water bottle industry is, for the most part, so wasteful) I was looking to replace it with something at least a tad bit more eco friendly. I like that this water bottle is stainless steel -- and I like the fact that I can continue to use the body and replace cap / straw as needed. Much better option that tossing the entire thing.<br /><br />The two features that I really like about this are the spill and leak-proof features of the cap. The straw parts flips up and in so that you don't need to worry about leaks if your kid tosses this in the car or in a bag (as long as it's closed of course). The bite valve is awesome for kids who tend to experience leaks with straws. Water does not flow freely from the valve, instead, your child needs to bite it to sip or, as my daughter has started to, squeeze and sip. It's great because you don't need to worry about the straw part leaking water.<br /><br />The bottle itself is made well. It's 18/8 stainless steel, but light enough for little kiddos and hands to carry. It's not the vacuum insulated version so you do get some condensation if you put cold beverages / ice in the bottle like with any stainless steel bottle. I've only used water that is straight from our fridge dispenser (cool water, colder than room temp but not ice cold), so I haven't dealt with the bottle being too cold issue that a few people have described.<br /><br />Cleaning wise this is much easier than some of the other bottles I've used. The valve is top rack dishwasher safe so you can put it though a hot cycle to disinfect. The straw is easy to remove and clean. I'm very happy with this bottle.",[],B07X97WW14,B0C8JG5D9H,AG3CK7F7NP5GM6BN6OHZJRWWF7QA,1583774141224,1,False,CamelBak,Steel,"Reusable, kids, straw top",Hatching Dinos,Straw,400.0,1

5.0,Love it!,"The fast flow spout is great, you get about as much flow as if you were drinking from a glass. The spring loaded cap is convenient, easy to use, and totally protects the spout from dirt, debris, and bugs. I love the velvety feel of the bottle. So far it seems to be fairly scratch resistant (I bump it into things a lot). The volume measurements make it easy to keep track of how much water I have been drinking. The lanyard is sturdy and convenient for carrying the water bottle. It comes with spare seals for the air hole and spout (in case of loss or wear). It also comes with a strainer insert for the mouth of the bottle. I'm guessing it's for if you have ice or something in the bottle so it doesn't obstruct liquid flow to the spout. The bottle is a good size, but it's just a little too wide to fit comfortably in motorized cart cup holders. It fits pretty well in regular cup holders. All in all, it is a quality product and I am pleased with it.",[],B011LC85PM,B07CM8GLN9,AFG6K6GX7NS6L5A7KOOA65CONWHQ,1494066803000,1,True,Embrava,Plastic,Standard Bottle,Gray,"Leak Proof, Lightweight, Flip Top, Lockable Lid, Shatter Resistant",946.352,1

5.0,Doesnt leak!!  Bit of a pain to clean if using for milk though!,"Got this to replace my 2yo grandsons bottle that is identical/same brand.  He chewed a hole in the mouthpiece so it's not the greatest thing ever but it's what he likes and it doesn't leak.  Ideal for water but his parents use it for milk too so it is a bit tricky to clean... Have to use a little tiny bottle brush and jamb it through the little holes to clean them out.  If you flip the lid over, you can see a small circular flap... locate that then find it on the top, down inside the top part when it's open - there are 3-4 small holes - jamb the tiny bottle brush in there to clean it out .  This little flap is a one way valve that allows air in but prevents liquid from leaking out.  A bit of a pain to clean but doesn't leak because of this little flap.  If you put milk in this, make sure you clean it better than my son did, lol.  I showed him the flap and he had no idea it was there... I got a chunk of old milk out of it so clean it well if you put milk in there!  Also blew my son's mind by telling him to put a few ice cubes in with the milk to keep it cold longer/keep it from spoiling so fast.  smh!  I spent more time cleaning his sippy cups (that leaked like crazy) in a day than he spends in a week cleaning his sons cup.
